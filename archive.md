#### A (mostly) plain text archive of _Solastalgia, USA_ posts from January 28 to October 10, 2016.  These were posted on my previous site, which was hosted on WordPress.  Like I mentioned in my [December 2, 2016 post](/2016/12/02/return.md) most of those posts were part of a school project.  I don't think they are my best work, so I'm putting this file up for anyone to read if it interests them, but I don't as yet have plans to migrate them into my new file management system.  It's a long document; use CNTRL-F to find your way around, or the table of contents.  If you want one of these articles put up on the current feed, [send me an email](/contact/) and I'll gladly polish and put it up.  Happy reading!

# The Truth About Climate Change

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) is the premier scientific body studying climate change.  Currently, 195 of the world’s foremost researchers of the earth system, atmosphere, oceans, and climate serve on the IPCC, which releases a three-volume, extremely comprehensive report on the state of the climate every year.  The IPCC offers advice, primarily to national governments around the globe, on how to deal with climate change.  Reports by the Panel are generally recognized as the authoritative statement on climate change from the scientific community.  To be a prominent member of the IPCC generally indicates that a scientist has the respect of his/her colleagues in the field of climate science.

Which makes it just a sprinkle of surprising that two former IPCC scientists have broken party lines so to speak, and come forward with a new report, published by the US affiliate of the Buenos Aires-based Fundación Ecológica Universal (FEU-US), that departs from the IPCC’s cautious and methodical tone about climate change.  The scientists, Sir Robert Watson, a former chairperson of the IPCC, and Dr. Carlo Carraro, a former vice-chair of the IPCC’s Working Group III, teamed up with five other climate experts from Switzerland, Austria, Argentina and the United States, to produce a report that was released to the public on September 29, 2016.  The report, provocatively titled “__[The Truth about Climate Change](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7HRGKIJWol-OEZfNDFjRHUwM2c)__”, comes after the major countries of the world signed an agreement worked out in Paris earlier this year that commits all signing countries to voluntary pledges to cut emissions - pledges that are reviewed every five years, but are _not_ subject to legal enforcement.  The goal of the Paris Agreement was to limit global temperature rise to less than 1.5oC and to keep the upward trend in temperatures to less than 2oC; the latter a threshold defined by scientists as the point [past which a warming atmosphere will be catastrophic](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/media/pdf/s/e/2degrees-map.pdf), triggering massive storms, flooding, sea-level rise, and drought - a global change in habitability that may be irreversible.  A long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction target set by the Paris Agreement is “a balance between anthropogenic (or man-made) emissions by sources and removal by sinks (the oceans, trees and plants) of greenhouse gases in the second half of the century”.

_(Note: All quoted text in this article is taken from the report linked above - __the first [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7HRGKIJWol-OEZfNDFjRHUwM2c) in the article__ - unless otherwise indicated.)_

Robert Watson and his colleagues agree that this is a worthy goal for the planet.  However, while Watson et al. see the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs; the “pledge” each country makes toward decreasing GHG emissions) from each country as a “real increase in the commitment by countries to combat climate change,” they also note that “current pledges are far from sufficient to put the world on a pathway to meet the 2oC target.”  That’s partly because some of the voluntary pledges by Paris signees are “unconditional” (mostly those from rich countries), while others, [mostly from poor countries](http://grist.org/climate-energy/rich-countries-sure-climate-change-will-screw-poor-countries-but-what-about-us/) who [have not yet contributed much to the dangerous rise in GHG concentration](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/01/science/earth/climate.html) in the atmosphere, are “conditional”, meaning the pledges need to be backed up with $100 billion/year in funding from rich developed countries ([who have contributed the vast majority of GHG emissions to the atmosphere thus far](https://www.oxfam.org/sites/www.oxfam.org/files/file_attachments/mb-extreme-carbon-inequality-021215-en.pdf)).

To get a picture of what we’re talking about, the amount of GHGs in the atmosphere in 1990, measured in “gigatons of CO2 equivalent”, or “GtCO2-eq”, was 38.

In 2010, the GHG’s in the atmosphere measured at 49.5 GtCO2-eq.  

In the most recent measurement, 54 GtCO2-eq were measured in the atmosphere.

The level of CO2 and other GHGs in the global atmosphere is increasing at an increasing rate (by avg. of 0.575 GtCO2-eq/yr over 20 years from 1990-2010, and by avg. of 0.75 GtCO2-eq/yr over the 5 years immediately following that).  In order to stay below the catastrophic warming scenario of exceeding 2oC, the authors of the study say, emissions need to be “reduced by 22 percent…to reach 42 GtCO2-eq in 2030.”  But the projections fall short of achieving that.  If only the unconditional pledges from the rich countries are implemented, emissions will actually rise 6% instead of dropping 22%, reaching 56 GtCO2-eq in 2030, as shown by IPCC data.  If conditional as well as unconditional pledges are implemented, global emissions will remain unchanged at the current level.  Furthermore, the gap between the currently projected emissions for the year 2030 and what emissions need to be in that year in order to avoid exceeding 2oC warming is 14 GtCO2-eq/yr. This “emissions gap” is similar to the emissions created by the entire world’s energy production in one year, which was about 17 GtCO2-eq in 2010.

If we, the planet, and future generations want to stave off 2oC+ warming scenarios, none of which look good, we need __net zero__ emissions.  If all signers of the Paris Agreement fully implement their INDCs, as specified under the Paris Agreement, that will _still not be enough_ to stave off catastrophic warming (as stated above, and by Watson et al.)  Full implementation of the Paris climate deal will only hold global emissions steady at the current, dangerous, level.  Although the IPCC lays out a broad range of systemic reforms to the planetary energy system, the delay in policy action as global leaders waited until the Paris convention convened means that “much more stringent and expensive options are required to hold global average temperature below 2oC”, the report by Watson et al. states.  They go on to say that:

> The IPCC concluded that the full implementation of GHG emission reduction measures by all countries in all sectors will not be enough to hold global average temperature below 2oC. Thus, additional measures will be required to cut CO2 emissions to net zero, using technologies to reduce CO2 emissions and to remove CO2 from the atmosphere.

What Watson, Carraro and their colleagues are suggesting is necessary is something called carbon capture and storage (CCS) and sometimes also called artificial carbon sequestration.  They describe “large-scale industrial plants [which] capture CO2…and store it before it reaches the atmosphere by injecting it deep underground.”  An extension of this strategy is coupling biofuel power plants to carbon capture technology - a class of proposed technologies collectively known as “negative emissions technologies” because, if no leaks or other malfunctions occur, the net effect from growing biomass and subsequently burning it while sequestering the CO2 released during combustion would imply a net-negative carbon emission.  However, the danger of CO2 leaking from underground storage is very high in a CCS system.  (I have written about the high frequency of [methane leaks from underneath fracking operations](http://solastalgiausa.org/viewer.php?x=25) on this blog, which is also a case of gas not “liking” being trapped underground.)  Additionally, such technology is largely unproven.  Where it has been implemented, the impact is not large.  Currently, the report claims “about a dozen” such plants exist and they “capture less than 0.1% of CO2 emissions - about 0.036 GtCO2-eq.  

“The inadequate INDCs have accelerated the need to depend on these technologies, the authors state.  In order to keep global average temperature rise below the 2oC threshold, global CO2 emissions need to drop to net zero by 2060-2075, which requres both “drastically reducing emissions” and “increasing the removal of CO2”.  Naturally speaking, oceans, trees, and plants are “carbon sinks” that absorb atmospheric CO2.  And the authors write that reforestation and afforestation “could considerably increase the removal of CO2”.  The reason this natural and proven method of carbon sequestration has been ruled out, the report explains, is that such a plan - to sequester all manmade emissions with forests - “would imply expanding the world’s forest cover, at least, twofold”, a policy choice that is “constrained by available land”.  

_(Interestingly - as a sidenote - there are others who support the use of forests as a primary mechanism for sequestering global emissions.  E.O. Wilson’s new book __Half-Earth__ purportedly explores this idea.  When I get a chance to read it, I’ll post a follow up.)_

Humanity, as Watson et al. see it, is being forced to rely on unproven technology for survival because our ambition isn’t high enough.  The authors:

> The high risks and costs of further postponing decisive climate action, such as the dependence on unproven negative emission technologies, can be reduced by raising the ambition of the INDCs. Taking earlier action will increase the options of feasible and more cost-effective measures to reduce global GHG emissions, and most importantly, will outweigh the risks and damage costs arising from the changing climate.

And now is the time for ambition, because, the study states:

> …the 1.5oC target has almost certainly already been missed because of the lack of action to stop the increase in global GHG emissions for the last 20 years.

Drawing on World Meteorological Organization data that shows, already, a 1oC rise in global average temperature and IPCC data that shows that 0.4-0.5oC of warming is due to occur no matter what due to “feedback” (or, energy stored and slowly released in oceans and other systems) from the oceans, the study concludes that the 1.5oC mark - what is considered “safe” by Paris Agreement standards - is already effectively out of our grasp.  1.5oC could be finalized by 2030, no matter what we do; and if nothing substantial is done, 2oC could be exceeded by 2050.  

The study leaves us with only two positives: 1) there is still time for countries to revise their INDCs upward, which will occur in 2018 before the pledges are enacted in 2020, and 2) the IPCC is committed to improving the readability of its reports in the future.

Especially in the USA — where two presidential debates have left us with a grand total of one question for either Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump (or their Vice Presidential nominees) that was [(almost) about climate change](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/10/10/the-presidential-debate-very-nearly-addressed-climate-change/?utm_term=.716cb352cd8e), even though [climate change-fueled Hurricane Matthew](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/05/climate-change-hurricane-matthew-sea-level-rise) was [pulverizing coastlines](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2016/10/10/the-presidential-debate-very-nearly-addressed-climate-change/?utm_term=.716cb352cd8e) in the American southeast - the outlook seems bleak.  It will take a lot to break through the [media blackout](http://www.democracynow.org/2016/10/6/amid_media_blackout_over_climate_change) on climate change.  But any time humans are educated, informed, and prepared for a challenge, there is hope.

# On Native reservations, groceries break the bank while Cheetos are cheap, food security report shows

A [working paper](http://www.firstnations.org/system/files/Indian_Country_Food_Price_Index_6-30-2016_FINAL.pdf) just released by the First Nations Development Institute further confirms a fact that one source called “[long suspected](http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2016/07/12/7-foods-cost-more-rez-and-one-junk-food-costs-less-165101)”: the cost of food on Native American reservations is significantly higher than the national average, except for the prices of processed junk food, which are significantly lower than the national average.  

Researchers compared prices gathered at eight grocery stores on or near reservation communities to the average prices nationwide over a period of six months between October 2014 and February 2015.  Their basket of goods included milk (averaging $.44 cents/gallon more expensive than the nationwide average), bread ($.66 cents/loaf more expensive), apples ($.83 cents/lb. more expensive), and coffee ($1.63/lb. more expensive).  Apples and coffee were consistently more expensive than the national average across all stores surveyed.  The only good surveyed that was consistently cheaper in grocery stores serving primarily Native populations was Cheetos (by 62 cents).  

This research, part of an ongoing project, highlights the deep-seated inequalities in our national food system, while giving more evidence for those calling for [Aboriginal food autonomy](http://theconversation.com/why-aboriginal-people-need-autonomy-over-their-food-supply-41812) on a global scale.

# Republican Party draft platform parrots coal lobbying groups

While the Democratic Party draft platform for 2016 does more to combat climate change than any party platform in the history of the country, the corresponding draft document from the Republican side of US politics calls coal a “clean” energy resource.  That language was [proposed as a single item line edit](http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4610196/clean-coal) from Texas delegate David Barton, who based his reasoning on the fact that technologies currently exist to filter out an insignificant amount of the atmospheric carbon released from coal combustion.  Cashing in on “clean” coal language brings the Republican party platform’s wording on coal to an almost word-for-word carbon copy of the [talking points](http://www.americaspower.org/coal-based-electricity/affordable/for-families/) issued by the energy industry lobby group “American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity” (ACCCE) which currently represents [32 corporations](http://www.americaspower.org/coal-based-electricity/affordable/for-families/) including Peabody Energy (a major coal company), American Electric Power, Trapper Mining Co., Western Fuels Association, and the Coal Utilization Research Council.  The ACCCE has not just been involved in the 2008 and 2012 elections, but also geared up heavily for the 2009 debates on cap-and-trade legislation (the Waxman-Markey Bill) by hiring a veteran energy lobbyist, ex-nuclear engineer Paul Bailey, to lead its lobbying efforts against the bill.  

See for yourself how close the final language in the Republican party platform is to the talking points from the coal industry:

This is from the Republican Party draft platform for 2016.  Coal is:
> an abundant, clean, affordable, reliable domestic energy resource

This is from the [lobbying website](http://www.americaspower.org/coal-based-electricity/affordable/for-families/) of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity.  Coal is:
> an affordable, abundant and increasingly clean domestic energy resource that is vital to providing reliable low-cost electricity

I don’t see much of a difference, do you?  Political party platforms are usually written to appeal to a base of voters who share your core values.  Who, then, does our current Republican Party consider its base?

# If you can’t stand the heat, talk to your legislator

To date, the Dust Bowl was the worst environmental disaster in the history of the United States.  In their ignorance, American settlers arriving in a foreign land (one that belonged to many indigenous nations) deeply plowed the topsoil of the Great Plains, uprooting native grasses and vegetation that had, with their deep root networks, both held moisture in the soil in periods of drought, and held the soil to the ground during high winds.  The result was predictable only in hindsight; at the time it was devastating.  A drought period beginning in the 1930’s parched the unrestrained topsoil, and strong winds blew it away, which further destabilized the remaining soil and caused the whole process to repeat over and over again.  More than a century earlier, in the 1820’s, explorer Stephen Long had explored the American West and, upon returning home, declared it the “Great American Desert” and recommended against settling there.  The Dust Bowl revealed to the country (those who were willing to look) the truth of Long’s diagnosis — as well as the destruction that Western settlement, agriculture, and technology could wreak on such a fragile ecosystem.  The Dust Bowl coincided with several years of record-setting heat across the Great Plains, the Midwest, and the Great Lakes regions.  For example, according to the National Weather Service of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), [the cause of the heat wave](http://www.weather.gov/arx/heat_jul36) (which led to 5,000 heat-related deaths and ruined harvests across the country) was “droughts” caused by “lack of rain” being exacerbated by “poor land management (farming techniques) across the Plains” which left the soil “without vegetation and soil moisture”.  During the summer of 1936, a high-pressure system set up over the west coast, and the “furnace” created by the weather conditions over drought-ravaged areas was funneled to the east, causing the record temperatures in which 5,000 people died.  Many of the temperature records from the heatwave of 1936 still stand to this day.

But those records won’t last for long in an age of anthropogenic climate change.  Forebodingly, they are already beginning to fall.  

The devastating heatwave of 2012 prompted many people to start looking for historical precedents, of which this rather nice [study by ClimateCentral](http://www.climatecentral.org/blogs/was-the-heat-wave-an-unprecedented-event) found only a handful: 1988 (when wildfires rages in Yellowstone National Park), 1954, 1936, and 1934.  Those last two both occurred during the Dust Bowl and were also in large part attributable to human-caused environmental degradation.  

A study published on July 7, 2016 uses new distributed computing techniques to [analyze with unprecedented exhaustiveness](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/7/074006) the devastating heat wave in the summer of 2003 that took the lives of up to 70,000 people in Europe.  It concludes that a significant proportion of the deaths in that event were directly attributable to the human activities that contribute to global climate change.   

But this year’s weather is even more concerning than the weather in 2012.  One reason for that (besides the fact that we are in our 14th straight month of record monthly temperatures) is that June 2016, was not just 3.3 degrees Fahrenheit above the 20th century average, but also **[surpassed the previous average June temperature record](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/sotc/summary-info/national/201606) of 71.6 degrees F, which was set in 1933 during the Dust Bowl.**  The above monthly report, issued by NOAA, also notes that in this year alone, the US has experienced *eight* disasters costing over a billion dollars to the taxpayer.  Despite flooding in Arizona and West Virginia, overall many states are experiencing less precipitation than usual, with the amount of drought-stricken land in the contiguous US rising by 3.5% from May to June.  Currently, 16.2% of the country is considered to be in a state of drought.  

In the area of pure climate research, [a new study](http://www.nature.com/news/clouds-get-high-on-climate-change-1.20230?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews) has updated previously-unreliable data on cloud cover, removing inconsistencies due to satellite drift, wear-and-tear on sensor equipment, and broken instruments.  The data from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) and Extended Pathfinder Atmospheres (PATMOS-x) are now usable to analyze cloud patterns between 1983 and 2009 (a “huge accomplishment”, according to a scientist not related to the study).  After analyzing the “new” data, the research team has addressed one of the “biggest source of uncertainty” when it comes to modeling the climate: that is, whether or not changes in cloud cover due to climate change will mitigate the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, or whether the behavior of clouds will instead exacerbate the effect of global warming.  They conclude that it will do the latter: as the effects of climate change proceed, clouds will float higher in the atmosphere and begin drifting toward the poles, exacerbating the overall warming effect.  

As usual, the arena of politics is behind in adapting to the scientific reality, with the idea of a carbon tax still being considered a radical step toward mitigating fossil fuel dependence and climate change.  However, some good things are happening in the political sphere with regards to climate change adaptation, at least on the Democratic side of the ticket.  The Democratic party platform committee met recently, and [finalized a draft of the party platform](http://grist.org/election-2016/sanders-final-win-climate-action-in-the-democratic-platform/) that includes some of the boldest proposals to ever approach the mainstream political discourse in this country.  [They include](https://berniesanders.com/democrats-pass-aggressive-climate-change-plan-party-history/) the aforementioned carbon tax, closing the Halliburton Loophole that exempts fracking from any regulatory oversight, strengthening the Safe Drinking Water Act, reducing methane emissions (i.e. natural gas leaks) by 40-45%, and removing language from the platform that called natural gas a “bridge fuel”.  These are all good, if numbingly incremental, steps in the right direction.  If the Democrats pass this platform, they will be the only party standing for a limited response to climate change.  If they don’t, no political party in the United States will be prepared to deal with climate change (presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton has actually positioned herself to the right of this new party platform on many issues related to climate change).  

The time has come to do something about the problem that we have spent the past two decades debating the existence of.  And the probable scenario if we continue down our current high-emissions path is not some exotic future out of *The Day after Tomorrow* climate change fantasies, but a blast from the past.  A [*Nature* Comment piece in 2012](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/05/24/478771/my-nature-piece-dust-bowlification-grave-threat-it-poses-to-food-security/) posited the idea of “the next dust bowl”, specifying that “drought is the most pressing problem caused by climate change”:

> Which impact of anthropogenic global warming will harm the most people in the coming decades? I believe that the answer is extended or permanent drought over large parts of currently habitable or arable land — a drastic change in climate that will threaten food security and may be irreversible over centuries.
> A basic prediction of climate science is that many parts of the world will experience longer and deeper droughts, thanks to the synergistic effects of drying, warming and the melting of snow and ice.
> Precipitation patterns are expected to shift, expanding the dry subtropics. What precipitation there is will probably come in extreme deluges, resulting in runoff rather than drought alleviation. Warming causes greater evaporation and, once the ground is dry, the Sun’s energy goes into baking the soil, leading to a further increase in air temp- erature. That is why, for instance, so many temperature records were set for the United States in the 1930s Dust Bowl; and why, in 2011, drought-stricken Texas saw the hottest summer ever recorded for a US state.

So, if you were wondering if it’s usually this hot out.

“Global warming to drive increase in severe thunderstorm risk in U.S., Stanford research finds”, [Bjorn Carey, September 25, 2013](http://news.stanford.edu/news/2013/september/climate-severe-thunderstorms-092313.html), *Stanford Report*:

> **New climate analyses** led by Stanford scientists **indicate that global warming is likely to cause a robust increase in the conditions that produce these types of (*thunder*) storms** across much of the country over the next century.
> … Sparse historical data describing the atmospheric conditions that cause severe thunderstorms has limited scientists' ability to project the long-term effects of global warming on storm frequency. But, **using a complex ensemble of physics-based climate models, researchers led by Noah Diffenbaugh**, an associate professor of environmental Earth system science at Stanford, have **produced the most comprehensive projections of severe storm conditions** for the next century.
> Scientists have identified **two main ingredients involved in generating a severe thunderstorm**. The first is that the atmosphere must contain a significant amount of what scientists call **convective available potential energy (CAPE)**, created as the air in the low atmosphere warms. The warm air rises, carrying with it moisture to higher altitudes.
> … **Climate researchers have previously hypothesized that global warming will increase CAPE** and cause an overall decrease in wind shear, which created uncertainty about the net effect.
> … **"We're seeing that global warming produces more days with high CAPE and sufficient shear to form severe thunderstorms," said Diffenbaugh**, who is also a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment.

“Changes in severe thunderstorm environment frequency during the 21st century caused by anthropogenically enhanced global radiative forcing”, [Trapp et al, 2007](http://www.pnas.org/content/104/50/19719.full).  *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences*:

> …**we find a net increase during the late 21st century in the number of days in which these severe thunderstorm environmental conditions (NDSEV) occur**… **this analysis suggests a future increase in NDSEV of 100% or more**…
> …when jointly evaluated, **the increase in CAPE more than compensates for the decrease in shear** such that the environment would **still be considered favorable for severe convection**. The result is a **net increase in NDSEV, the number of days on which meteorological conditions would support the formation of severe thunderstorms**.
> Identified model biases obscure the details of the projected number of severe days, with **regional reanalysis data suggesting significant model underestimates**. **Nonetheless**, in terms of percentage changes in NDSEV in the late 21st century relative to present, **our analysis suggests the possibility of an increase of up to 100% or more** in locations such as Atlanta, GA, and New York, NY.

# Photos and notes from Break Free

May 16, 2016 in Whiting, Indiana, was a brisk spring day.  High of 70F, low of 43F.  In the morning, there was a slight haze over the water, and the wind blew hard off the lake – an onshore breeze, someone sagely remarked as we passed each other on the pier.  The end of the pier in Whiting’s Lakefront Park is the perfect place to see the Chicago skyline in the distance.

![](IMG_2367-1024x804.jpg)
![](IMG_2368-1024x768.jpg)

After snapping a picture of downtown Chi-town, if you simply do a 180-degree turn on the pier, you’ll see a completely different type of skyline:

￼![](IMG_2370.jpg)

This is the BP Whiting Refinery, the fifth largest refinery in the United States and the largest refinery owned by British Petroleum.  [Beginning in 2008 and continuing until 2013](http://abarrelfull.wikidot.com/whiting-refinery), the refinery completed an extensive “modernization” project.  Prior to the upgrade, it was processing “light, sweet” crude oil from various sources.  Now, it focuses almost exclusively on processing “ultra heavy and sour” crude oil, shipped to the refinery from Canada.

So in other words, this:

Welcome to Whiting.

![](IMG_2366.jpg)

Over a thousand people had gathered in Whiting, along with 70 local organizations, to protest a planned expansion of BP’s tar sands refinery and the neighboring Koch Industries KCBX shipping hub.  The action was part of a [two-week long series of protests across six continents](https://breakfree2016.org/) called “Break Free from Fossil Fuels”.  [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/may/16/break-free-protest-fossil-fuel) newspaper also called it “the largest ever global civil disobedience against fossil fuels”.

People brought jars of water from their hometowns and there was a water ceremony led by indigenous leaders as we organized, giving thanks and respect to the great lake and the many waters coming together in this action.  There was smudging, music, and prayer.  Some brave souls decided to kayak in the freezing waters next to the refinery:

![](IMG_2380.jpg)  
It’s called “kayaktivism”…get it?

We gathered.  Some people spoke.  Olga Bautista, a warrior for environmental justice and member of the Southeast Environmental Task Force said some wise words about migration, climate change, toxic waste, and organizing:

Mark Burrows from the United Transportation Union Local 1433 and the Railroad Workers United reminded us of the dangers of shipping oil by train (see: Lac-Megantic) and the importance of solidarity. Since then, a catastrophic oil train explosion in Oregon has unfortunately borne out the truth of his words.

Claire McClinton from Flint was there. “I send you greetings from the occupied and poisoned city of Flint, Michigan,” she said. “One day,” she continued, “we’re going to have a society worthy of people who come to each other’s aid – we don’t have that now.”

Lorrell Kilpatrick, a working-class social justice organizer from East Chicago who has worked with the Coalition for Clean Environment and now organizes for Black Lives Matter, spoke as well, from the position of a local person of color, and about the links between social justice and environmental justice. “My whole family is from East Chicago…a neighborhood called New Edition,” she said. “You know what the backyard of New Edition, is, right? BP. A row of oil tankers that you can see right outside the living room window of my family home.”

Bill McKibben wrote a book called *The End of Nature* in 1989. He was ahead of the curve. Now he is the head of 350.org, a group calling for an urgent response to the climate crisis. He admitted that when he got started in organizing, he didn’t think that the climate movement could win a fight like the one against the Keystone XL Pipeline or the Northern Gateway Pipeline in Canada. But he was wrong. “When we fight, we win, so we should probably fight more often,” he said.

Tara Houska from Honor the Earth and Native American advisor to the Bernie Sanders campaign, was there, to remind us that now is the time of the Seventh Fire, a time to make a choice that will define the future of humanity. If you watch nothing else, watch this:

And then we marched.

￼![](IMG_2389.jpg)
￼![](IMG_2390.jpg)
￼![](IMG_2394.jpg)

One thing I noticed while we marched to the front gate of the refinery, is how much more confident and familiar the younger members of the crowd (including college and high school students) were with the ideas underpinning the protest; how much more passion and less fear you could feel from the younger parts of the crowd, including many younger than me. This gives me a sense of hope. We, as a people, are learning to not be afraid about standing up for what’s right.

The picture of Berta Caceres held up above the crowd also struck me. Caceres was an indigenous environmental activist from Honduras. She was assassinated – [gunned down in her home in La Esperanza](http://www.democracynow.org/2016/3/4/remembering_berta_caceres_assassinated_honduras_indigenous) – on March 3, 2016. Questions have arisen after her death about [United States involvement](http://www.democracynow.org/2016/5/24/obama_urged_to_stop_funding_honduran) in her assassination, because Honduras is currently ruled by the victors of a 2009 coup that overthrew the popularly elected government and the United States is the key foreign ally of the coup regime. Just recently, a bill was introduced in the US Congress – the “Berta Cáceres Human Rights in Honduras Act” – that would [halt all funds to Honduras for military or police purposes](http://www.democracynow.org/2016/6/15/in_honor_of_berta_caceres_rep), including funding for equipment and training that is currently funneled to the Honduran government through the “Northern Triangle’s Alliance for Prosperity Plan”.

Wish you could have been there, Berta.

For a small town, Whiting put a lot of police officers on the streets that day.  I saw cars from the Gary P.D., the county sheriff’s office, Chicago P.D., and the local police.  A boat from the Sheriff’s department patrolled the waters outside the refinery, and a white helicopter circled lazily in the sky over the protestors all day.

But not even any of this could top the ridiculous police presence at the front gates of the refinery.

There’s a scene in the movie *The Princess Bride* where the villain tells his underlings to post “thirty men” outside the castle gates to keep the heroes out.  In the movie (watch it for this scene if you haven’t already) the guards – bumped up to “sixty men” after word gets out the heroes are coming – stand in slightly comical formation with their backs to the gate, clutching their weapons across their chests.

Even though it represented every kind of despised overreaction from our militarized police force, all I could think about when I saw the police battalion guarding the front gate of the BP refinery from the peaceful climate protestors, was that silly scene from *The Princess Bride*:

￼![](IMG_2393.jpg)  
“There is only one way into the castle. The gate is guarded by…sixty men.”

So, what do they think they’re going to use those cudgels for, again?  The peaceful climate protest that includes old grandmothers and very young children?

You can see video of peaceful protestors being arrested by these guys for sitting at the gates, below; as well as other scenes from the protest.  You can also check out this blog post by a guy who was arrested at BP’s front gates.

Break Free was invigorating, productive, peaceful, and an overwhelmingly positive experience.

There will be a next time.  I will see you there, my friends and relations.

# Watershed revitalization in China’s Loess Plateau: An international interlude

### Introduction

We ended our last post by moving the conversation about Flint, MI’s water crisis onward, away from political finger-pointing, and toward a discussion of the ongoing environnental degradation of the Flint River watershed.  Tim Carmody’s well-researched and [excellent article on The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/2016/2/26/11117022/flint-michigan-water-crisis-lead-pollution-history) supplied us with a trove of information on the myriad ways the Flint River watershed has been desecrated by more than a hundred years of human neglect and disrespect.  Among the many examples of watershed pollution include “raw sewage discharges from Flint’s wastewater plant”, “road salt on the city’s bridges rais(ing) the river’s chlorine levels” – and therefore the water’s corrosivity to the city’s lead pipes – and industries like General Motors leaving behind “heavy metals like arsenic, mercury, and lead, toxic solvents, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polynuclear aromatics (PNAs) including petroleum compounds.”

The issue raised by this research is simple, yet enormous: if we want to understand our human impact on the environment, in any frame of reference from global climate change to biodiversity loss to pollution, we need to think in terms of entire watersheds and entire river basins.

With your permission, I would like to go on a brief jaunt beyond *Solastalgia, U.S.A.*‘s usual stomping grounds, to take a look at an international watershed issue, which may shed some light on what needs to begin happening in the United States: the reclamation of one of China’s most damaged watersheds, the Loess Plateau, at the headwaters of the Yellow River in north-western China.

### The Loess Plateau

The Loess Plateau, located in parts of modern-day Qinghai, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu Provinces as well as the Ningxia Autonomous Region (home to the ethnic Hui minority) and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, is located at the headwaters of the Yellow River and has long been known as “the cradle of Chinese civilization”.

![](figure-1-maps-showing-location-and-coverage-of-the-loess-plateau-gradual-strengthening.png)  
Location of Loess Plateau; map courtesy of Feng Min-Li on ResearchGate.net

It is the “cradle of Chinese civilization” because Chinese civilization began with the outset of human settlement and agriculture along the river valleys in this region.  Until pretty recently, the evidence for this was literary and semi-mythical.  The Xia Dynasty, the semi-mythical kingdom that preceded the first verifiable dynasty in Chinese history, the Shang, was reputed to be located in this area.  But thanks to the intersection of archeology and paleoclimatology, there is now evidence of not just human settlement on the Loess Plateau, but the climate and ecology of the region during those periods of early human settlement.

A [2004 study](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Cheng-Bang_An/publication/200032593_Environmental_change_and_cultural_response_between_8000_and_4000cal.yrBP_in_the_western_Loess_Plateau_northwest_China/links/547670fc0cf245eb437279dd.pdf) by Chengbang An of Lanzhou University, Zhaodong Feng of Montclair State University, and Lingyu Tang of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology entitled “Environmental change and cultural response between 8000 and 4000 cal. yr BP in the western Loess Plateau, northwest China” sheds some light on several prehistoric cultures on the Loess Plateau and their environment.  They identify the human settlements originating in the region thusly:

> The earliest known neolithic culture in the western Loess Plateau is the Dadiwan Culture (7800–7350 cal. yr BP), followed by the Yangshao Culture (6800–4900 cal. yr BP), Majiayao Culture (5300–4300 cal. yr BP) and the Qijia Culture (4300–3900 yr BP) (Shui, 2001).

So we are talking about very ancient human civilization in the region, going back to about 5800 B.C. and possibly earlier.  The study uses analysis of pollen, sediments, and aquatic fauna to arrive at this conclusion about the “palaeoenvironment and palaeoclimate evolution of the western part of Chinese Loess Plateau during 8000–4000 cal. yr BP”:

> **It was wet between 8300 and 7400 cal. yr BP**. During this period, pollen concentration was high and the local vegetation became forested. Tree and shrub pollen dominated the pollen assemblages. Aquatic molluscs (snails endemic to shallow and standing water, such as Gyraulus) were abundant. Together with the high content of organic matter, a high carbonate content and finer grain-size, **these proxies indicate that the climate was wet**.
> **Between 7400 and 6700 cal. yr BP, a humid and warm climate prevailed in the area**…During this time, the abundance of arboreal pollen points to the dominance of coniferous trees and deciduous broad-leaf mixed forests. The high content of organic matter, carbonate and finer grain-size also indicates that the climate was wet.
> **From 6700 to 6300 cal. yr BP**, pollen concentration declines, broad-leaf tree pollen decreases, although tree and shrub pollen account for more than 50% of the pollen assemblage indicating that the vegetation was forest-steppe…**the climate was semi-humid**.
> **During 6300–4000 cal. yr BP**…the decrease in arboreal pollen, and the increase in herbaceous plant pollen…suggest that the vegetation changed from forest-steppe to steppe…Concurrently, the swampy–wetland gradually dried as indicated by the strata and increasing abundance of terrestrial molluscs. **During this period the climate was semi-arid**.
> **After 4000 cal. yr BP**, the proportion of herbaceous plant pollen increases to about 80%…**The climate was dry. This probably indicates the termination of the mid-Holocene Maximum in the area** (An et al., 2000; Zhou et al., 2002).

In other words, from 8300 years ago to 4000 years ago, the environment gradually shifted from wet to semi-arid, and finally to a dry climate.  Concurrently, human settlement increased gradually, but eventually exponentially.  The study authors also show how human settlement was indelibly linked to the climate in this region.  From the study:

> …**the stability of these agricultural societies was intimately tethered to the vicissitudes of climate**.

In other words, it is very likely that the change in climate and ecology was due, at least in part, to human settlement and agriculture.  At first:

> The neolithic cultures developed slowly, as indicated by the predominance of small archaeological sites.  The number of sites increased slowly and the extent of the early Yangshao Culture was limited to the Hulu River basin.

However, later on:

> When the climate changed to semi-humid, the number of small settlements increased as the neolithic farmers settled at increasingly higher elevations (Li et al., 1992). This resulted in the cultivation of greater areas of land and a greater areal distribution of human populations. Archaeological excavation reveals that sites of middle to late Yangshao Culture became larger and more complex.

And ultimately, as the climate became concurrently less forested, drier, and more extensively settled:

> When the climate changed to semi-humid and semi-arid, and the vegetation changed from forest steppe to steppe, the number of archaeological sites increased rapidly and the distribution of settlement expanded dramatically.  The archaeological evidence implies that the Majiayao and early Qijia cultures practised productive agriculture and manufactured fine painted pottery.

But then came the collapse.  The study authors describe it like this:

> **Around 4000 cal. yr BP, there was a distinct climatic shift from semi-arid to dry**. It has been reported that **the Qijia Culture collapsed** after 3900 cal. yr BP **probably due to climatic deterioration** (Shui, 2001).

By no means does the collapse of the Qijia Culture 3900 years ago spell the last time that ecological change has affected the politics, economics, and culture of Chinese civilization.  In the literary and cultural record, there is much folklore about floods and natural disasters ending periods of dynastic rule in China.  This is quite probably why the Chinese central state often spent so much effort and money on infrastructure projects damming, diking, or redirecting the flow of rivers — especially the Yellow River, whose frequent and disasterous floods through the centuries have earned it the nickname “China’s Sorrow”.

However, the connection between ecological degradation and disaster and national politics does not only exist in the literary record.  [A 2005 study (Zhang et. al)](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Harry_Lee6/publication/227036720_Climate_change_war_social_unrest_and_dynastic_cycle_in_ancient_China/links/00b49533c29bdb7e66000000.pdf?origin=publication_detail) done by a group of scholars at the University of Hong Kong entitled “Climate change, social unrest, and dynastic transition in ancient China” puts the folklore into scientific context.  Comparing paleoclimate data with the historical records of “wars, social unrests, and dynastic transitions…from the late Tang to Qing Dynasties”, they found that most wars, and 70-80% of “war peaks” occured during periods of ecological stress.  Taking issue with the “Dynastic Cycle” model used to explain the historical rhythm of the rise and fall of the Chinese central state, they conclude that “**climatic change was one of the most important factors in determining the dynastic cycle and alternation of war and peace in ancient China**“, as opposed to the proposal that “dynastic rise-and-fall, social accord-and-discord, and economic upturn-and-downturn (*were*) closely related to the trend of societal development and the quality of emperor’s governance.”  The latter theory sounds reasonable, “however, there are not any quantitative evidences to sustain the theory,” the authors state.  On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence suggesting that the cause of civil unrest in ancient China is rooted in ecological disturbances, as these data show:

￼![](screen-shot-2016-05-05-at-7-16-37-pm.png)
Authors’ description is already good; but note — “cold phases” of ecological stress on agriculture are shaded in gray

So, what have we learned thus far?  To put it simply, the Loess Plateau in north-western China is one of the earliest areas of human settlement, agriculture, and civilization.  It is the headwaters of the Yellow River, one of the most important rivers in China.  But it has also been subjected to millenia of human-caused ecological devastation, to the point that vast areas of the Plateau are virtually a desert, and huge erosion gullies carve the landscape into deep ravines.  In the past, environmental devastation of this kind has caused deep political, economic, and social crises for the Chinese people.

What does this kind of ecological degradation look like, visually?  Well, this is what the Loess Plateau looked like in Shanxi Province in 1987:

So this, visually, scientifically, historically, and politically, is the problem.

Is there a solution?

It seems like the answer is: yes.  Here is what the solution looks like, visually.

How did this immense reversal of ecological fortunes come about?  To understand that, we need to investigate two related programs initiated by the Chinese government in the late 1990’s under the objective of rehabilitating: the National Forest Protection Program and the Grain to Green Program.  Read on to find out more.

### Tackling the Problem

As we have discussed, above, the root cause of the desertification of the Loess Plateau is thoughtless human abuse of the region’s resources, through human agriculture and settlement.  However, in order to begin addressing the Plateau’s problems through policy, proximate causes for the lack of vegetation, the erosion, and the dryness had to be understood.

Juergen Voegele, an agriculture expert, was at the time the head of the World Bank’s Agriculture Unit in China.  During the Loess Plateau rehabilitation projects, he was on the ground working in co-operation with Chinese experts and the local people of the Loess Plateau.  However, his vision is much broader than one project, one region, or even one watershed.  In a World Bank [blog post from September 2014](http://blogs.worldbank.org/voices/delivering-climate-smart-agriculture), Voegele wrote:

> **Agriculture is being left behind at a time when it should be leading on climate action**. Few other sectors are as vulnerable to climate change, or as primed to contribute to delivering solutions for the billions affected. **We need to grow at least 50% more food to feed a projected 9 billion people by 2050**.  This won’t be easy–a warming climate threatens to cut crop yields by more than 25% and endanger the lives and livelihoods of more than 75% of the world’s poor, who are farmers. **However, let’s be clear, agriculture is also a major part of the climate problem. It generates around a quarter of total greenhouse gas emissions.  Without action, that number could rise to almost three quarters of the total permissible emissions** to stay within a two degrees world.

Voegele has been pushing for an agriculture that is “climate-smart”, and the progress toward that goal begins in the Loess Plateau.

Chinese experts in hydrology, soil dynamics, forestry, agriculture, and economics, supported by the World Bank, identified several proximate causes for the desertification of the Loess Plateau.  Three of the most serious factors were the cutting of trees for fuel wood, planting crops on steep slopes, and, most destructively, the free grazing of goats and livestock on landscapes that were already stripped of almost all vegetation cover.

The World Bank and Chinese Ministry of Water Resources [report on the project](http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website00819C/WEB/PDF/CHINA_LO.PDF) lays out the effectiveness of each of the project’s component parts:

Terracing slopes is essential to preventing the type of intense water runoff that plagued the area in the past.  Previously, when water hit the slopes on the Loess Plateau, it would almost immediately turn into runoff and wash away, taking sediment with it on its flow downhill to the Yellow River.  This caused serious issues with downstream flooding as well as severe erosion gullies carved into the landscape upstream.  Terracing the slopes allowed farmers to continue planting on hilly land without contributing to erosion.  According to the project report, farmers claim that: “before the project, the wheat output per ha was about 100 kg per mu (one fifteenth of a ha) and 150 kg at the most, just enough to feed the family. But now, the ordinary output is above 2000 kg”; and the desire for terraced fields has spread beyond the project area, with some farmers outside the area reporting “many farmers in the village want to convert slopelands into terrace because the slopelands can’t keep rainwater and moisture is easy to evaporate, so that the output is hard to increase”.

Afforestation through the planting of timber and arbor trees, as well as orchards of fruit trees, was also successful.  More than 30,000 hectares of orchards (mostly apples) were planted, and 27,000 hectares of apricots, chestnuts and walnuts were planted on former wasteland.  This is in addition to 290,000 hectares of arbor trees like pine, spruce, poplar, and black locust.  Trees serve an important ecological function in keeping soils from washing away downhill.

However, the most important vegetative form of erosion control was the replanting, and natural return of grassland.  Some grassland was intentionally replanted, but a bigger impact on revegetating the slopes came as a result of the Chinese government implementing a ban on open grazing of goats and other livestock.  The grazing ban “had a dramatic effect on the vegetative cover even in drought-affected areas. Despite the droughts, natural shrubs, grasses and trees are now well established on steep slopes that had previously been grazed bare.”

[A report](http://unu.edu/publications/articles/north-west-china-water-supply-impacted-by-vegetation-restoration.html) analyzing the Loess Plateau restoration produced for the United Nations University in 2015 points out that the return of grassland to this area might have a bigger impact than its reforestation, for sound scientific reasons:

> A [recent study](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jpln.201400090/abstract) on the impact of land-use changes on soil hydraulic properties in NW China’s Loess Plateau showed that vegetation restoration has significantly improved the [hydraulic properties of soil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_conductivity) that are responsible for water’s movement through it. **The study also illustrated that, compared to generally accepted afforestation, grassland is more capable of enabling water infiltration and mobility**. Tree growth can change the properties of soil in a way that inhibits water from moving through it, while **grassland can provide a stable soil [macropore](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macropore) system that enhances water mobility**.

Perhaps most importantly, the project emphasized to farmers that “marginal” lands, namely slopes, gullies, and other fragile features, were to be left to passively rehabilitate themselves.  One important way this was done was to designate any incline measuring over 25 degrees as off-limits to agriculture.  Passive rehabilitation was shown to result in massive long-term benefits to the health of the soil and vegetative cover.  [According to](http://eempc.org/loess-plateau-watershed-rehabilitation-project/) an ecologist involved in the project, an “understanding” gradually built up that “ecological function” was “vastly more valuable than the production in these marginal lands”.

Finally, according to the [World Bank/Ministry of Water Resources study](http://web.worldbank.org/archive/website00819C/WEB/PDF/CHINA_LO.PDF), the construction of dams at the base of hills allowed eroded sediment and water to accumulate and settle, creating fertile plains at the base of hills so that farmers would no longer have to plant on the hillsides.  These types of dams are known as “warping dams” and are a clever way of creating rich productive croplands by harnessing the erosive power of the annual spring rains.

But all of this is esoteric and hard to imagine unless you can really see the transformation that took place on the Loess Plateau from the 1990’s to today.  A Chinese-American filmmaker, ex-cable news cameraman, and ecologist, John D. Liu, was, luckily, on site to capture the transformation of the area on film.  An abridged version of his [feature-length documentary Lessons from the Loess Plateau](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjNDiBCb-mE), shot in partnership with the World Bank, is below:

https://youtu.be/6iJKiFSQLn4

One of the most striking facts from the documentary above and its full-length version (worth watching) is the return of native plants and animals to the Loess Plateau ecosystem entirely of their own accord, due to having a healthier ecological foundation.  In this day and age – the Anthropocene Epoch and the Sixth Extinction, both of which we have discussed before on this blog – any project that *restores* biodiversity in an ecosystem rather than diminishing it is a **big deal**. 

How big of a deal is the fact that birds, butterflies and bees are returning to the Loess Plateau as a result of the watershed rehabilitation project?  Well, take it in context with [this article](http://thebulletin.org/biodiversity-loss-existential-risk-comparable-climate-change9329) recently published on the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists website:

The article begins:

> According to the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, **the two greatest existential threats to human civilization stem from climate change and nuclear weapons**.
> … **But there is another existential threat that the Bulletin overlooked (…): biodiversity loss**. This phenomenon is often identified as one of the many consequences of climate change, and this is of course correct. **But biodiversity loss is also a contributing factor behind climate change**. For example, **deforestation** in the Amazon rainforest and elsewhere **reduces the amount of carbon dioxide removed from the atmosphere by plants**, a natural process that mitigates the effects of climate change. So **the causal relation between climate change and biodiversity loss is bidirectional**.

The article also mentions the Sixth Extinction:

> The **repercussions of biodiversity loss are potentially as severe as those anticipated from climate change, or even a nuclear conflict**. For example, according to a 2015 study published in Science Advances, the **best available evidence reveals “an exceptionally rapid loss of biodiversity over the last few centuries**, indicating that a **sixth mass extinction is already under way**.”

And concludes with a warning about the dire consequences of such a loss of biodiversity:

> According to a 2012 paper published in Nature, there are reasons for thinking that **we may be approaching a tipping point of this sort in the global ecosystem**, beyond which the consequences could be catastrophic for civilization…As the authors write, a **planetary-scale transition could precipitate “substantial losses of ecosystem services required to sustain the human population.”**

In such a context, it is extremely important that you can again hear bird songs, see bees and pollinators buzzing from flower to flower, and feel humid air in a region that was once in real danger of becoming a desert.

### The Dirt and the Sky

Unless you are paid to believe otherwise or actually living under a rock, it is undeniable that the atmospheric level of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is a major international cause of concern for the human race in the 21st century.  Further evidence of this is shown in a [recent study](http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/2001/20120294) by James Hansen, Makiko Sato, Gary Russell, and Pushker Kharecha entitled “Climate sensitivity, sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide” (2013).  In fact, if anything, the study shows that the problem is worse than we know.  It begins:

> Humanity is now the [dominant force](http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/2001/20120294.full#ref-1) driving changes in the Earth’s atmospheric composition and climate. **The largest climate forcing today**, i.e. the greatest [imposed perturbation](http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/2001/20120294.full#ref-2) of the planet’s energy balance, **is the human-made increase in atmospheric greenhouse gases (GHGs), especially CO2 from the burning of fossil fuels**.

However, it continues by reminding us that the Earth’s surface water reserves, both in liquid and solid forms, creates an “inertia” in observed climate effects.  This means that we aren’t actually noticing all of the greenhouse gases we’re pumping into the atmosphere.  Or, as the authors put it:

> This long response time makes the task of avoiding dangerous human alteration of climate particularly difficult, because the human-made climate forcing is being imposed rapidly, with most of the current forcing having been added in just the past several decades. Thus, observed climate changes are only a partial response to the current climate forcing, with further response still ‘[in the pipeline](http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/2001/20120294#ref-3)’.

The authors analyze paleoclimate data from the Cenozoic and conclude that this delayed atmospheric response to fossil fuel combustion is actually hiding a worse outcome than previously predicted.  This means, according to the authors, that:

> Burning all fossil fuels, we conclude, would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans, thus calling into question strategies that emphasize adaptation to climate change.

Can humanity actually burn all the fossil fuels left in the ground?  The answer, Hansen and his co-authors say, depends on whether we choose to extract not just the rest of the conventional fossil fuel sources, but also all of the unconventional sources like “tar sands, tar shale, and hydrofracking-derived shale gas”:

> Thus, it seems, **humanity stands at a fork in the road**. As conventional oil and gas are depleted, **will we move to carbon-free energy and efficiency—or to unconventional fossil fuels and coal? If fossil fuels were made to pay their costs to society**, costs of pollution and climate change, **carbon-free alternatives might supplant fossil fuels** over a period of decades.
> **Whether governments continue to be so foolhardy as to allow or encourage development of all fossil fuels may determine the fate of humanity**.

In other words, we’re poisoning the sky with black soot and combustion byproducts.  If the situation is as bad as Hansen is telling us (and there’s no reason to believe otherwise) then we may need not only to stop all fossil fuel combustion – and keep all the coal, oil, and gas in the ground where it belongs – but also find ways to mitigate and sequester the carbon dioxide already released into the atmosphere.

Funny enough, we already know how to do that.

I’m not talking about half-baked schemes to develop machines or giant synthetic filters to suck CO2 out of the sky.  The fact is we already have green technologies that sequester carbon dioxide very effectively.

And we have already put them to work on the Loess Plateau.

In 2013, a team of researchers including Feng Xiaoming, Fu Bojie, Lu Nan, Zeng Yuan, and Wu Bingfang [published a study](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02846) in the journal *Nature Scientific Reports* entitled “How ecological restoration alters ecosystem services: an analysis of carbon sequestration in China’s Loess Plateau”.  They focused on three ecosystem measures relating to carbon sequestration: NPP (net primary productivity), or the total carbon amassed by plants and other photosynthesizers, NEP (net ecosystem productivity), or the difference between NPP and the microbial respiration in the ecosystem, and soil carbon sequestration.  Their findings were significant:

Over the period 2000-2008, they found that NPP increased by a significant margin, which is unsurprising considering the massive amount of planting that was done during the program.  NEP also increased by a significant margin.  Whereas in 2000 four of the five climatic zones of the Loess Plateau were carbon sources – that is, they were generating atmospheric CO2, intensifying the global greehouse effect – in 2008 the study found that all of five of the climatic zones were now carbon sinks – in other words, they were now sequestering carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in plant matter and soil organic carbon.  The study also found that soil carbon storage increased over the study period, but the length of the study was insufficient to produce significant data.

The most noteworthy objection to this study would be that “changes in climate” could have contributed to the increased carbon sequestration of the region.  However, the study’s authors disagree with that suggestion for well-founded reasons:

> …**We also examined the changes in annual precipitation (P) and mean annual temperature (MAT) over 2000–2008**. However, **we found no significant change** in P or MAT for either the entire region or any of the separate bioclimatic zones ([Fig. 3](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02846#f3)). **Statistical analyses also showed no significant correlations between NPP or NEP and the climate variables** (P \> 0.45). **Hence the observed significant increases in NPP and NEP over the Loess Plateau were unlikely caused by climate change**. On the other hand, the places experiencing a significant increase in annual NPP were found mostly within the GTGP program areas (comparing [Fig. 1b](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02846#f1) and [Fig. 2b](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02846#f2)). In addition, the rates of annual NPP and NEP increase for each zone were linearly correlated with the acreage of restored shrubland in that zone (R2 ≥ 0.78, P ≤ 0.04) ([Fig. 4](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02846#f4)). **These results suggest that the increased annual NPP and net ecosystem sequestration across the Loess Plateau from 2000–2008 were mostly due to the implemented ecological restoration program**.

The study thus concludes on a cautiously optimistic note.  In the discussion on their findings, the authors conclude:

> Our results demonstrated a significantly increasing trend in ecosystem carbon sequestration over the fragile Loess Plateau (19.2 g C m−2 per year on average) since the implementation of the GTGP program, which resulted in a total of 96.1 Tg C fixed in this land. **The Loess Plateau ecosystem had shifted from a net carbon source in 2000 to a net carbon sink in 2008. This sequestration of carbon is [equivalent](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02846#ref14) to 6.4% of China’s total fossil fuel carbon dioxide emissions in 2006**. It should be noted that the restored area in the Loess Plateau [accounted](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep02846#ref15) for about 6.4% of the total area covered by the GTGP program. Therefore, **the GTGP program has made substantial contribution in mitigating China’s anthropogenic CO2 emission**.

They do add some reservations, such as the important role of precipitation in the process of carbon sequestration through ecosystem restoration; although they also remind us that choosing “vegetation type according to the local climatic restraints” will help mitigate the demand for water, a practice that is already ongoing in the affected regions, with good results.

Meanwhile, another study, published in the journal *CATENA* in 2011, included optimistic readings of the soil organic carbon content in the Loess Plateau region, a measure that the study above was agnostic on.  On a “hill-slope scale” of analysis, soil organic carbon increased at rates between 8.6% and 24.6% between the years 1998 and 2006, while on the scale of “small watersheds” soil organic carbon increased by about 19% in the surface soil layer.  The study indicated that the results “demonstrated general positive effects of vegetation restoration on SOC sequestration at multiple scales”, and that “therefore, **vegetation restoration was proved to be a significant carbon sink**, whereas, **erosion could be a carbon source** in high erosion sensitive regions”, which helps to fill in the gaps in the discussion of soil organic carbon sequestration in the *Nature* study above.

Thus far, we have talked about three major topics: the first is the environmental history of the Loess Plateau, which is a tale of anthropogenic ecosystem degradation on a massive scale; the second is the heroic efforts to rehabilitate and revitalize the Loess Plateau ecosystem through an intensive agroforestry and hydrological engineering project; and the third is the positive effect similar efforts may have on a global climate that is rapidly spinning out of control due to human activity.  These are all fundamental, global, international issues, despite being seemingly situated in one local area.  The most redeeming feature of the rehabilitation efforts in the Loess Plateau from the perspective of the Earth is the focus on the entire watershed, from rainfall in the mountains to the floods downstream.  The most redeeming feature from the perspective of the Sky and the atmosphere is the possibility that these sorts of human projects may mitigate or even undo the thoughtless violence we have wreaked on the global climate by incessantly burning fossil carbon.

We have the technology.  It’s the oldest technology in the book.  Will we use it?

# Flint is still poisoned while we bicker about it, schools and hospitals are lead-poisoned nationwide — so let’s start talking about watersheds

### Introduction

We need to start talking about the water poisoning crisis in a different way.  Starting right now.

We need to stop obsessing over the politics in Lansing and D.C., stop gleefully replaying [Matt Cartwright’s castigation of Rick Snyder in Congressional hearings](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtQ9LHlpZ9o), and start acknowledging that the drinking water in Flint is *still poisonous*, and will continue to be poisonous *until* we replace all of the Lead Service Lines in the city.

We also need to acknowledge that this crisis is widespread.  All over the country, water systems are being found to have dangerously elevated levels of lead and disinfection byproducts.

We need to stop talking about this like it is one isolated issue, and acknowledge the fundamental issue that Flint’s water crisis has exposed to the world: we have spent the better part of a century ignoring our responsibility to our rivers, lakes and streams in favor of short term profit for ourselves.  This has to change.

Let’s begin with Flint.

### Flint

The latest round of lead and copper testing in the city (all tests completed by 4/18/16) show that some of the highest levels of lead yet recorded in the city were discovered during recent testing.  At least 8 distinct testing locations now show lead levels above the level classified as “hazardous waste” — which is 5,000 ppb (parts per billion), or about 333.3 times greater than the maximum level considered “safe”, 15 ppb.  At least 40 tested locations have lead levels exceeding 1,000 ppb, and as of the latest released round of testing, 1606 distinct tests have shown lead levels above the 15 ppb threshold.  A sort-able Google Sheet of the lead testing data can be [found here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1K54Y4r4OvTKHYPs3XsE676Ccjsw3ycVcy65BMiz3W4U/edit?usp=sharing).

This just makes it all the more silly when our esteemed Governor Snyder pulls a PR stunt like [saying he’ll drink Flint water for “the next 30 days”](http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/04/18/snyder-says-he-drink-flint-water-next-30-days/83193374/).  In fact, his exact words were:

> “Flint residents made it clear that they would like to see me personally drink the water, so today I am fulfilling that request. And I will continue drinking Flint water at work and at home for at least 30 days.”

But god forbid he actually drink it for 30 days straight, because apparently he’s [leaving for a “a week-long European trade mission”](http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/04/22/gov-rick-snyder-leaves-europe-saturday-amid-flint-water-crisis/83399552/) as of April 23, so apparently he’s editing his words while he “put(s) words to action”:

> “He pledged to drink it at home and at the office for at least 30 days, total,” spokeswoman Anna Heaton said. “Traveling with jugs of water overseas isn’t feasible, but he’ll resume drinking water from Flint upon his return.”

We’re all tired of seeing our elected officials clown around for us.  When Snyder pulls these stunts, it’s no different than when [ex-Mayor Dayne Walling said he drinks the water “every day” in April of last year](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/04/flint_mayor_dayne_walling_on_t.html).  And if you didn’t get enough PR cheese when you saw the video of Snyder drinking a glass of water from a Flint resident’s tap, you can see Walling and ex-Emergency Manager Darnell Earley [drinking glasses of Flint River water in this video from April of two years ago](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/04/watch_mayor_dayne_walling_em_d.html).  It’s all the same.

Flint doesn’t need propaganda.  It doesn’t need Snyder to “do penance” by drinking water from the city he poisoned.  Flint needs solutions.

So let’s talk about those solutions.

It is common knowledge among drinking water experts that preventing lead leaching into drinking water requires removing Lead Service Lines (LSLs), which are the small water pipes that branch off from water mains into households, even if proper corrosion control methods are in place (such as the addition of orthophosphates to the water; a process that Flint skipped during the rule of state Emergency Managers).  This is because, as Virginia Tech professor Yanna Lambrininidou said in [an interview with Michigan Radio](http://michiganradio.org/post/where-are-lead-water-pipes-michigan-here-s-our-best-guess#stream/0):

> “But **(*corrosion control*) is also equally understood** to not be, under any circumstances, a panacea; to **not be under any circumstances, to prevent at all times lead leaching** from plumbing materials, including lead service lines,” (*Lambrininidou*) said.
> **Pipes still age and deteriorate with corrosion control treatment**. Lambrininidou says stagnant water and physical disturbances can **still cause high lead levels, even with proper treatment**.
> “**Knowing where these hazards are is imperative for the protection of the public’s health**,” she said.

So it’s imperative to find the Lead Service Lines that are supplying Flint homes, and remove them.

There is a problem, though.  Flint’s city records, which are supposed to show which properties are served by LSLs, are not in good shape.  How bad are they?  Well, in November of last year, [Michigan Radio reported](http://michiganradio.org/post/after-news-reports-state-asks-flint-lead-service-line-info#stream/0):

> A little over a week ago our Flint reporter, Steve Carmody, got to check out the city’s records in person.
> **Flint’s water distribution supervisor**, Robert Bincsik, **showed Carmody sets of old maps, and a few filing cabinets full of handwritten index cards** from the last 100 years or so. **These are Flint’s records**.
> “It’s not ideal, but **it is what we have**. Personally, I spent a lot of time in the field so … **there are a lot of things about the water system** that I know **that are just in my personal memory** and a lot of the guys are the same way. We do with what we have and we try to do the best we can, but this is what we have,” Bincsik said.
> Flint technically should already know where all its lead service lines are. The city is responsible for keeping those records but it just hasn’t done that.

The Flint city government, therefore, needed someone to map the city’s unmarked Lead Service Lines.  Enter the UofM-Flint Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Center, led by Dr. Marty Kaufman, which spent three months mapping the properties in Flint that are served by LSLs.  Thanks to [their research](https://www.umflint.edu/gis), we have a picture of the work that needs to be done in Flint.

￼![](gis-lead-pipes-map.jpg)  
Properties in Flint served by LSLs, courtesy of [UM-Flint GIS Center](https://www.umflint.edu/gis)

So there it is.  This is the work that needs to get done.  At least 4,376 properties in Flint need to have their Lead Service Lines replaced, in order to prevent the continued poisoning of the city.

(As a quick sidenote, how bad is the poisoning of the city’s water?  While the official line is that drinking the tap water is not safe but bathing and showering with it is, researchers are raising questions about that assumption.  [Scott Smith from Water Defense says](http://nbc25news.com/news/local/researcher-skeptical-after-snyder-says-flint-water-safe-to-bathe-in): “It is irresponsible and incomprehensible that anyone could declare that bath and shower water is safe based on drinking water and drinking water standards,” adding that the “water has not been tested for the full spectrum of chemicals.”  Those chemicals [include](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/04/water_defense_calling_for_bath.html) “disinfection byproducts”, [including chloroform](http://www.democracynow.org/2016/3/22/on_world_water_day_see_our#t=0m37s) (another name for trichloromethane), formed by “organic matter reacting with the disinfection chemicals that create the disinfection byproducts.”)

How much work has been done on replacing the LSLs in Flint?

Not enough.  Rowe Professional Services Company, a Flint-based construction group, was given a $500,000 contract to “begin a pilot project” to replace 30 of the city’s LSLs.  As of April 1, 2016, Michigan Radio [reports](http://michiganradio.org/post/flint-pipe-removal-effort-working-through-early-delays#stream/0) that “crews had finished work on only 19.”  Only 4,357 to go?

We should also remind ourselves, as Rowe Services crawls along at a snail’s pace, that this could have been done much more quickly for a fraction more cost.  While a Snyder administration email estimates it will take 15 years for Rowe to complete the project, Flint’s local plumbers union estimated that for $60 million, the project of replacing the city’s LSLs could be accomplished in two years:

> (*Harold*) Harrington (*Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 370*) estimates that he **could reasonably call in about 20 such teams to work full time until the job is done**. Assuming the rate is forty pipes a day, roughly 249 days a year (nights and weekends, y’all), the Flint plumber’s militia **could bang the job out in just over two years**.

Rowe, on the other hand, is charging $55.5 million for, thus far, doing less than 2/3 of the work they need to do.  Perhaps we shouldn’t be terribly surprised about this.  For one thing Rowe Services is named as [a defendant in a racketeering lawsuit](http://www.legalreader.com/michigan-governor-snyder-named-in-racketeering-suit/) being brought by citizens of Flint, for its role in causing the crisis in the first place.

For another thing, there’s no reason that a preferential contract to replace the pipes should go to the state’s preferred contractor when other crews (Plumbers and Pipefitters Local 370, Waldorf and Sons) have demonstrated that they are just as capable of doing the work, and have shown and expressed that they are willing to do it more promptly.

In fact, the first replacement of a Lead Service Line in Flint was done not recently by Rowe, but on March 3, 2016 through a citizen crowdfunding and organizing effort led by the Flint Coalition.  That replacement, done by Waldorf and Sons Excavating, was stopped briefly by Flint Police and state officials, who wanted to check their permits:

> Weaver’s spokeswoman Kristin Moore said in an email to The Flint Journal: “It is my understanding that **officials (police, etc.) were in the area for another reason** when they noticed the construction scene and **stopped to make sure everything was in order**.”
> Michigan **Department of Environmental Quality officials** working with local water response teams **also arrived at the scene to question contractors** on who authorized work on the pipes.

We’re spending too much effort playing childish politics, and not enough effort concentrating on the real problem: 4,376 lead service lines that need replacing, and no time to lose.

### U.S.A.

On April 20, 2016, it was revealed in EastLansingInfo.org, my favorite source for local news, that 31 faucets in the school district which I graduated from, East Lansing Public Schools, [tested positive for high amounts of lead](http://eastlansinginfo.org/content/31-faucets-high-lead-levels-found-east-lansing-schools).

Previously this year (1/20) it [was revealed](http://eastlansinginfo.org/content/lead-glencairn-elementary-faucet-causes-concern) that one faucet in Glencairn Elementary School was known to have problems with high lead levels because a sign over the faucet read: “flush this faucet for five minutes each day before drinking to reduce lead levels to acceptable health limits”.  The sign was believed to have dated “back to the 80’s or early 90’s”.  In response to this discovery, it was reported by East Lansing Superintendent in a letter to families that “water was turned off to the sink” and that “seven other faucets/fountains were also tested”.

According to the latest EastLansingInfo.org article, the testing that was done in the school in January was not extensive.  Glencairn Principal Lorraine Ware:

> “At that time they tested every drinking fountain and then sampled faucets in each wing. They did not test every faucet in the school.”

After more than 1,000 samples were taken from all active schools during spring break, it was revealed that 31 sites in the district showed high levels of lead contamination.

Luckily, none of the students at Glencairn have tested positive for high blood lead levels to date.

For the curious, the total list of sites testing positive for lead ([courtesy of ELi](http://eastlansinginfo.org/content/31-faucets-high-lead-levels-found-east-lansing-schools)):
> * 3 at Donley Elementary – girls’ bathroom sink, mechanical/custodial room, library storage room sink.
> * 4 at Glencairn Elementary – mechanical/custodial room, girls’ bathroom sink, M. Foster’s classroom sink, K. Nordquist’s classroom sink.
> * 1 at Marble Elementary – faculty men’s bathroom sink.
> * 6 at Pinecrest Elementary – multi-purpose storage room sink, kitchen 3 compartment sink, mechanical/custodial room, Z. Konett classroom sink, mechanical/custodial room, library storage room sink.
> * 1 at Whitehills – S. Wagner classroom sink.
> * 12 at MacDonald – unisex bathroom sink, mechanical/custodial room, 3 kitchen sinks, 5 unused sinks in V. Watson’s classroom, unused storage room sink in R. Voigt’s room, unused storage room sink in S. Jackson’s room.
> * 4 at East Lansing High School – 3 in mechanical/custodial room and 1 in the wood shop room (room 715).
> * Red Cedar Elementary School has not yet been tested.

In fact, many school districts around the country are revealing that drinking fountains and faucets in their school buildings are contaminated with high lead levels.  This is because schools, hospitals, and commercial sites are often on different systems than the residential water system, and these non-residential systems are often tested less frequently.

There are many similar examples of this from schools around the country.  For example:

On March 10, 2016, Reuters reported that the [Newark Public School District shut off water fountains](http://fortune.com/2016/03/10/lead-was-found-in-the-water-of-new-jerseys-biggest-school-system/) at 30 of its school buildings in response to testing that revealed that 59 of the 300 samples taken were above the 15 ppb action level for lead.  The testing was prompted by [reports of discolored water](http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2016/03/09/newark-public-schools-lead-in-water/) at an elementary school.  An official with the state Department of Environmental Quality said:

> “A lot of **these are older schools with older piping, with lead piping, or solder**, that we need to address long-term.”

In March 2016, two private religious schools in Jackson, Mississippi, St. Andrew’s Episcopal Lower School and St. Richard’s Catholic School, revealed that they had high lead levels on their school campuses.  St. Andrew’s had tested positive for “the presence of lead in the school’s water at high levels, above the actionable level of 15 parts per billion”, but refused to release specific numbers.  “We haven’t talked to anyone who could actually help us parse out the precise root of the levels,” Head of School Tim Alford said.  St. Richard’s “notified parents of its students in February of the lead-in-water issue, asking them to send water bottles to school with their children,” [according to the Jackson Clarion-Ledger](http://www.clarionledger.com/story/news/local/2016/03/07/jackson-school-water-tests-high-lead/81432648/).  Several homes in Jackson have already tested positive for high lead levels, and the city has [been going through](http://www.wapt.com/news/central-mississippi/jackson/jacksons-lead-water-problems-started-6-months-ago/38215814) a process of official denial and a lack of communication with residents about the problem.

Ten schools in Oregon have tested positive for high lead levels since 2012, sometimes with astronomical figures.  At Corvallis’ Fairplay Elementary, which closed and reopened in 2003 as the Corvallis Waldorf School, high lead levels were detected as early as 1993, and have been measured as high as 327 ppb (in 2010).  Schools reporting high lead levels in the past five years, [according to the Statesman-Journal](http://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/tech/science/environment/2016/03/20/school-drinking-water/81660898/), include:

> Emerald Christian Academy, Pleasant Hill; Kidco Head Start Sunnyside, Foster; Willowcreek Elementary, Vale; Valley Inquiry Charter, Salem-Keizer School District; Rural Dell Elementary, Molalla; Eddyville Charter, Lincoln County; Corvallis Waldorf School, Corvallis; Scappoose Adventist, Scappoose; Lebanon High School’s Land Lab, Lebanon; and at least one building in the West Linn/Wilsonville School District.

In Ithaca, New York, local school districts are hesitant to admit a problem, but faucets in the Ithaca City School District have [tested](http://www.ithacajournal.com/story/news/local/2016/03/03/10-schools-fail-lead-tests-results-questioned/81282788/) as high as 265 ppb (Northeast Elementary) and 470 ppb (Belle Sherman Annex).  [In addition](http://www.ithacajournal.com/story/news/local/2016/04/07/new-icsd-lead-testing-slated-release/82762736/):

> “On Feb. 24, Ithaca City School District Superintendent Luvelle Brown released water testing data from 2005 showing that drinking water throughout the school district could have exceeded the EPA limit for lead during the past 11 years.

In Binghamton, New York, “more than 30 water sources in Binghamton City schools have been shut down” including “two drinking water sources” after tests done in 2013 (and not retested and acted upon until February of 2016) revealed actionable levels of lead in the water. Because the school district receives its water from the City of Binghamton, “there is no federal or state testing requirement,” [WBNG-Binghamton reports](http://www.wbng.com/news/local/Binghamton-schools-lead-levels-shut-down-water-sources-370093481.html?).

You get the picture.

And it’s not just schools that are also at risk from lead contamination.  As we mentioned before, it’s also hospitals, commercial buildings, and other areas that are served by separate or private water systems.

Morristown Medical Center, a major hospital in New Jersey, [was revealed](http://www.nj.com/morris/index.ssf/2016/03/lead_in_morristown_hospitals_water_was_73_times_ov.html) earlier this year to be pumping water out of its taps that was contaminated with lead.  The exposure window, estimated at about January 25 to February 22, 2016, including one location measuring 1,100 ppb, three locations measuring over 700 ppb, and seven measuring over 300 ppb.  Despite having previously been issued two violations by the New Jersey Environmental Protection Agency, the “possible root cause” of the contamination was the “non-operation” of the hospital’s corrosion control system.  Doesn’t that sound familiar?

Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center in Santa Fe, New Mexico has a similar problem.  [According to the Santa Fe New Mexican](http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/too-much-lead-at-the-tap-christus-st-vincent-s/article_fbf4a30a-f8fa-51c1-8176-e76019f1d395.html), “water tests at Christus St. Vincent Regional Medical Center have turned up hazardous levels of lead every year since 2011,” and, [additionally](http://www.santafenewmexican.com/news/local_news/state-says-santa-fe-hospital-failed-to-divulge-use-of/article_73f052b6-caa0-5629-9836-480eedaffa42.html), the hospital “neglected to tell the state it has been using a private well that may have contributed to high levels of lead in some of the facility’s drinking water samples in the past five years”.  “Blending” well water with city water, much like Flint EM Mike Brown proposed doing with water from the Flint River in 2012, seems to be the cause of the hospital’s lead contamination problem, as corrosive well water ate away at lead pipes and soldering in the hospital’s plumbing fixtures.  Employees were not notified of the hospital’s continued failure of water quality tests.

Again, you get the picture.

### Here’s the Point

The wider point that we need to understand is this: through public policy, corporate greed, and simple ignorance, we have allowed human activity to damage and degrade water quality across the country.  As a good friend of mine often says:

“When will we realize that we can live without oil, but we cannot live without water?”

It’s extremely important to consider the facts that Tim Carmody laid out in a February 26, 2016 article for The Verge.  He concludes:

> The river, the city, and the people were all mistreated for years. The lead pipes and shoddy water treatment built on a century of pollution and neglect. They compounded and concentrated an ongoing human-made environmental disaster, with few analogies or precedents.

That “century of pollution and neglect” includes some truly horrific acts of water degradation and disregard for public health.  Some highlights:
* The Flint River “had long been known as an exceptionally polluted river. Until very recently, it had been repeatedly ruled out as a primary source for the city’s drinking water. It is hard to imagine why anyone familiar with the river’s history would ever decide to use it even as a temporary water source.”
* “The city had been drawing its drinking and industrial water from the Flint River since 1893, and discharging its untreated waste downstream…In the 1930s, the fish began to disappear…The once-plentiful stocks of walleye in the Flint River completely collapsed by the 1940s, due to polluted water poisoning incubating eggs.”
* “Raw sewage discharges from Flint’s wastewater plant raised fecal coliform bacteria; phenol from GM plants and ammonia from the wastewater plants contributed toxic materials. These chemicals cause skin rashes, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal diseases, and other health problems when ingested.”
* “Road salt on the city’s bridges raised the river’s chlorine levels, making the water more corrosive. This has continued into the present and may have been one reason poorly-treated Flint River water was so damaging to metal pipes.”
* “General Motors did its part to pollute the Flint River watershed, too…Contaminants left behind include heavy metals like arsenic, mercury, and lead, toxic solvents, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and polynuclear aromatics (PNAs) including petroleum compounds.”
* “…illegal and accidental dumping were rampant. In 1990, a furniture salesman was convicted of dumping entire drums of methylene chloride, toluene and xylene, lead and other chemicals onto his property on the banks of the river…There are dozens of stories like this.
* “…in 1999…A subcontractor digging a trench…opened a 6-inch-wide, 5-foot-long gash in an unmarked 72-inch pipe running from the city’s sewers…Over two days, 22 million gallons of raw human, industrial, residential, and commercial waste poured into the river.”
* “…nine communities in the Flint area reported 90 illegal sewage overflows over the preceding five years…”
* “…the city continued to discharge untreated and partially treated sewage into the river during heavy rains, snowmelts, and power outages, including an 8-million-gallon spill in March 2006 and a 18.1-million-gallon spill in September 2008…”

Carmody’s article is well-worth a read.  If you click on no other link in this article, click through on this one.  It’s a phenomenal example of how information technology can combine with old-school archival research and result in something sorely needed in the modern world: topical, relevant, and useful environmental history.

It’s also important to consider the message of this article: we have destroyed not just the human-made water infrastructure in Flint, but also, through centuries of ignorance, neglect and plain greed, we have **degraded an entire watershed**.

This is where smart, 21st-century conservation needs to begin — at the scale of the entire watershed, and the whole water cycle.

### Loopholes and Exceptions

There is one other related that I want to bring up before we conclude.  Namely, that the systematic attack on water resources in this country is not restricted to polluting rivers, streams and other waterways.

Three quick examples:

Graham Kates, deputy managing editor for The Crime Report, compiled [a database](https://opendata.socrata.com/Government/Mini-EPA-Violators-Database/r65z-8y77) of EPA violators [and found](http://www.thecrimereport.org/news/inside-criminal-justice/2014-07-environmental-crime-the-prosecution-gap) that in response to the roughly 64,000 corporate violations of pollution laws, “in fiscal year 2013, the EPA’s Criminal Enforcement Division launched 297 investigations. In 2012, 320 investigations were opened; the total has steadily decreased since 2001.”

EPA rules, written in the 1980’s, currently allow the intentional contamination of groundwater aquifers as a means of disposing of industrial waste, even though this contradicts the Safe Drinking Water Act.  According to a [NRDC brief](https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/wat_16032203a.pdf), “a little-known program administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is exempting large swaths of the nation’s aquifers from this important law, and endangering drinking water sources.”

And finally, last year was the sad anniversary of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, which allowed for two things: it gave the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), which is unaccountable to public control, sweeping powers to supersede state and local control of pipeline and drilling infrastructure, which allowed for the formation of regional energy cartels which have become increasingly influential in Washington; and most importantly, through a section of the law known as the “Halliburton Loophole,” it “explicitly exempted fracking operations from key provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act”, according to this [report](http://www.alternet.org/environment/10-years-later-fracking-and-halliburton-loophole), which continues, “This means that 10 million Americans — and truly many more — have been placed directly in harm’s way. Hundreds of peer-reviewed studies have connected fracking to serious human health effects, including cancer, asthma and birth defects.”

We cannot drink, bathe in, or irrigate crops with oil.  When will we learn that we cannot live without water?
##### Solastalgia, USA: Apr5/2016

# Local news: Sulfuric acid spill at MSU power plant

Around 8:30 am this morning, the T.B. Simon Power Plant on the Michigan State University campus reported a major chemical spill. According to a local news report, “[hundreds of gallons of sulfuric acid](http://wlns.com/2016/04/05/developing-acid-spill-reported-at-msu-simon-power-plant/)”, also known as battery acid, were spilled inside the plant, which is located on Service Road toward the south end of residential campus. When I walked by at around 11 am, the WLNS news team confirmed that it was a “sulfur” spill (checking the written report, above, that the same team put out, the chemical was sulfuric acid, H2SO4, a sulfur-containing compound) and that the “first floor” of the plant was “evacuated”.

UPDATE 8:03 pm: [WLNS has released a follow up story](http://wlns.com/2016/04/05/msu-power-plant-sulfuric-acid-spill-leads-to-day-long-cleanup/) with some added details. The spill was in the basement of the power plant, springing from a leaky valve connecting the inside tank with a larger outside tank, both filled with sulfuric acid. The quantity spilled is now estimated at 800 gallons. In addition, some unknown, but probably very small, amount of the toxic gas sulfur trioxide, which results from the reaction of sulfuric acid with heat and air, was released from the spill. (This is probably why people standing downwind of the plant, like where I was this morning, smelled that distinctive “rotten egg” sulfur smell in the air.)

Sulfuric acid, H2SO4, is an colorless and odorless strong mineral acid. It is commonly used in all sorts of industrial activities from manufacturing fertilizer to refining petroleum. Although “more sulfuric acid is produced **and spilled** in the chemical industry today than any other chemical”, nevertheless “the market for sulfuric acid is still very strong and will continue to grow”, according to researchers from Environment Canada ([Lawuyi & Fingas, 1998](http://aevnmont.free.fr/SACH-BOOKS/Petrochemistry/Handbook%20of%20Hazardous%20Materials%20Spills%20Technology/Part%20VIII.%20Perspectives%20on%20Specific%20Chemicals/35.%20Perspectives%20on%20Specific%20Substance%20%20Sulfuric%20Acid.pdf)).

One might wonder, with good reason, why “hundreds of gallons” of sulfuric acid were present at the Simon Power Plant. It’s unclear to me at this time exactly why the tank of sulfuric acid was present at this particular power plant. A [report by the Electric Power Research Institute](https://www.aep.com/environment/EmissionsAndCompliance/tri/chemicalprofiles/SulfuricAcid.pdf) does state that sulfuric acid is one downstream byproduct of carbon combustion:

> Sulfur is present in coal and oil. When electric utilities burn these fuels in their power plants, some of the sulfur is released. This sulfur combines with oxygen to form sulfur dioxide and small amounts of sulfur trioxide. Sulfur trioxide combines with water vapor released during combustion to form sulfuric acid vapor.

And [Lawuyi & Fingas](http://aevnmont.free.fr/SACH-BOOKS/Petrochemistry/Handbook%20of%20Hazardous%20Materials%20Spills%20Technology/Part%20VIII.%20Perspectives%20on%20Specific%20Chemicals/35.%20Perspectives%20on%20Specific%20Substance%20%20Sulfuric%20Acid.pdf) state in their study that most of the sulfuric acid manufactured today is recovered as a waste product from various industrial processes:

> Today, a large proportion of the sulfuric acid produced in the world is what is termed ‘‘fatal’’ acid, which is manufactured to prevent substantial amounts of waste sulfur dioxide formed in metallurgical and smelting processes, such as nonferrous metal smelting and iron production from pyrites, from entering the environment (Inco Limited, 1985; Muller, 1997). (Sec. 35.2)

So it is vaguely possible that the stored sulfuric acid at the Simon plant was recaptured from the power plant’s emissions. **But** it may be more likely that the tank of sulfuric acid was used to clean the power plant’s cooling towers and prevent them from “fouling” from the residue of burnt fuel, as mentioned in this [report by Emerson Process Management](http://www2.emersonprocess.com/siteadmincenter/pm%20rosemount%20documents/00830-4200-4811.pdf), an industry logistics firm, from 2007:

> A power station requires a sufficient supply of sulfuric acid as part of the water treatment regimen for the cooling towers. If the sulfuric acid supply is inadequate, fouling of the cooling system is possible.

Regardless of how it got there, the acid spilled. [According to WILX](http://www.wilx.com/home/headlines/Acid-Spill-at-MSU-Power-Plant-374614821.html?ref=821), an MSU spokesman, Jason Cody, has confirmed that the spill is thought to have originated from a “leaky valve” on a storage tank that was connected to an inflow of sulfuric acid from another reservoir. When the leak was detected, the flow of acid to the faulty storage tank was “isolated”. More concerningly, however:

> Jason Cody tells News 10 that he did not yet know how much acid was spilled or the extent of the damage, but that some of the acid did go down the drain.

So this is not good news. Especially if you read the reports such as the one by Lawuyi & Fingas, because they repeatedly emphasize that for leaks and spills of sulfuric acid, the #1 priority is to prevent the chemical from entering any sort of water system:
> 35.3.5 Spill Control
> *Wear self-contained breathing apparatus and full protective clothing for all emergency measures involving sulfuric acid.*
> *Leaks*: **Keep the acid away from water sources and sewers**. Build dikes to contain flow as necessary. Neutralize spilled material with agricultural lime (CaO), crushed limestone (CaCO3), soda ash, or sodium bicarbonate. **Keep material out of water sources and showers** and spray large liquid spills with vapor-smothering foams.
> … *Spills*: Wear appropriate chemical protective gloves, boots, and goggles. Avoid contact with contaminated material. Evacuate spill site and restrict access. Issue warning: ‘‘Corrosive, Poison.’’ Notify manufacturer and relevant authorities. Contain spill if it is safe to do so. **Avoid contact with liquid or vapor**. Stay upwind. Vapor cloud collects in low-lying areas. **Keep contaminated water from entering sewers or watercourses**. For small liquid spills, neutralize with lime. For large liquid spills, **contain spill as much as possible**. Neutralize spilled material with crushed limestone, soda ash, or lime.
> … *Air spill*: Apply water spray or mist to knock down vapors. **Liquid produced** is corrosive and toxic; it **should be diked and neutralized**.
> *Water spill*: **Neutralize with agricultural lime (CaO), crushed limestone (CaCO3), or sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3)**.

Thankfully, the East Lansing wastewater plant has “the ability” to treat the water. The water treatment plant “was notified” of the spill, according to [WILX](http://www.wilx.com/home/headlines/Acid-Spill-at-MSU-Power-Plant-374614821.html?ref=821), but no word yet on their plan of action for treating the contaminated water. Let’s hope CaO, CaCO3, or NaHCO3 is involved.

Also good news is that, thus far at least, no reports have said that any airborne aerosols of sulfuric acid were released by the spill. Airborne aerosols of sulfuric acid are [epicly bad news](http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/phs/phs.asp?id=254&tid=47), in fact they were [one of the main reasons why](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/learning/learn-about-the-weather/weather-phenomena/case-studies/great-smog) the infamous London Smog of 1952 was so dangerous to human health. (**UPDATE 8:03 pm**) However, [WLNS is now reporting](http://wlns.com/2016/04/05/msu-power-plant-sulfuric-acid-spill-leads-to-day-long-cleanup/) that some unknown but probably small quantity of sulfur trioxide, which can form when sulfuric acid is heated in the open air, was released as a consequence of the spill.

This spill at MSU joins a legion of other sulfuric acid spills across the country, including the [2015 spill in Indian Orchard, Massachusetts](http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2015/07/sulfuric_acid_spill_at_indian.html) that spilled between 500 and 1,000 gallons of the toxic chemical from a similar holding tank at a power plant, and a huge spill last month, on March 9, 2016 in Hopewell, Virginia, where a [100,000 gallon tank of sulfuric acid violently exploded at a textile factory](http://www.prwatch.org/news/2016/02/13046/honeywell-contractor-osha-taxpayer-dollars) owned by Honeywell International, Inc.

Sulfuric acid is extremely damaging to the environment. Lawuyi & Fingas remind us that:

> Sulfuric acid is a **powerful acidic oxidizer** and a **strong dehydrating agent**. It is **harmful to many microorganisms, plants, and aquatic life** in concentrations as low as 6 mg/L.

# Drying up the American Nile: Solastalgia in the American West

Welcome back!  Sorry for the hiatus.  I just got back from a wonderful spring break and I hope anyone reading this also enjoyed their week.  Even two national parks, 25+ miles of hiking, and 48 hours of road tripping isn’t quite enough to keep my mind entirely from what this blog is about, however.  Still — so often it was totally and completely entrancing:

The view of The Zion Narrows from Angel’s Landing.  Zion National Park, UT.

However, in my free time, when my breath wasn’t being taken away by the view (or the 10,000+ feet of elevation we climbed over the course of the week), there was plenty to think about when it came to *solastalgia*. 

For example, during our journey, we drove along the Colorado River for a stretch in eastern Utah, and also, many miles to the south, past Lake Powell on the Utah-Arizona border.  They call the Colorado the American Nile sometimes, as it is huge and mighty and cuts through a climate otherwise-uninhabitable by dense human populations.  Accordingly, it’s also [one of the most over-exploited rivers in the world](http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/photos/rivers-run-dry/#/freshwater-rivers-colorado-1_45140_600x450.jpg).  In recent years, the Colorado River has rarely even reached its delta — which should empty into the Gulf of California, but now rarely does.

[Peter McBride](http://www.petemcbride.com/INFO/bio/1), an award-winning filmmaker from Colorado, made a pretty [great short film about this for National Geographic](https://vimeo.com/63943253).  It’s called “I AM RED”:

[https://vimeo.com/63943253](https://vimeo.com/63943253)

The cause of the Colorado’s demise is all the dams that drown sections of its waterway — [15 dams on its main course](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_dams_in_the_Colorado_River_system), irrigating arid Western farms and ferrying water to cities as far away as Los Angeles, with hundreds more dams dotting the mighty river’s tributaries.  It is human demand for water (some of which is, frankly, opulent and wasteful) that is making the Colorado River dry up, like this, in the northern Mexico desert:

![](21_rdh_2010-11-01_mg_25221.jpg)  
Mudflats of the Colorado River Basin, northern Mexico.  [Photo by Ronald De Hommel](http://www.ronalddehommel.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/21_RDH_2010-11-01_MG_25221.jpg).

So, solastalgia is everywhere.  At least, everywhere that human actions are degrading the environment — which is a great deal of places, these days.

These days.  There is a word for “these days”, actually.  It’s the “Anthropocene” geological epoch, a term that saw [its first usage](http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/05/11/confronting-the-anthropocene/?_r=0) by University of Michigan freshwater ecologist Eugene Stoermer in the 1980’s, but was first formalized in the [May 2000 edition](http://www.igbp.net/download/18.316f18321323470177580001401/NL41.pdf) of the “Global Change Newsletter” of the [International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme](http://www.igbp.net/) by Stoermer and Nobel laureate atmospheric chemist Paul J. Crutzen of the Max Planck Institute for Chemistry (Germany).

In 2008, the International Commission on Stratigraphy of the London Geological Society agreed on [a proposal](http://quaternary.stratigraphy.org/workinggroups/anthropocene/) to consider the Anthropocene, defined by Stoermer and Crutzen, as the current geological epoch.

It’s not difficult to understand the basics of what defines the Anthropocene epoch.  The basic idea is that modern human existence on the planet has had a profound and fundamental impact on natural processes, like the circulation of water and air around the globe and the lives of all the organisms that make up the biosphere, and has even created new rocks under our feet.  One of my favorite bullet points from the London Geological Society proposal is the article about plastic rocks:

> * [Rocks made of plastic found on Hawaiian beach](http://news.sciencemag.org/earth/2014/06/rocks-made-plastic-found-hawaiian-beach). Angus Chen reports on a new type of rock cobbled together from plastic, volcanic rock, beach sand, seashells, and corals that has begun forming on the shores of Hawaii on the [Science](http://news.sciencemag.org/earth/2014/06/rocks-made-plastic-found-hawaiian-beach) website.

Not all the facts of the Anthropocene Epoch are quite so quirky, however.  One of the most significant pieces of evidence for the existence of a new epoch is the mass species extinction that humankind is currently living through — the [sixth mass extinction](http://time.com/3035872/sixth-great-extinction/) in Earth’s 4.5 billion year history.  Which means that this topic is Very Serious Stuff Indeed.

If this is the Anthropocene, I would rather not live in it.  This is a point on which Glenn Albrecht (philosopher, professor, farmer, and incidentally also the creator of the term “solastalgia”) and I agree.  On Dec 17, 2015, he wrote, [on his personal blog](https://glennaalbrecht.wordpress.com/2015/12/17/exiting-the-anthropocene-and-entering-the-symbiocene-via-sumbiocracy-symbiomimicry-and-sumbiophilia/):

> **In the Anthropocene**, the so-called ‘new normal’, or what I prefer to conceptualise as ‘the new abnormal’, **life will be characterised by uncertainty, unpredictability, genuine chaos and relentless change. Earth distress**, as manifest in global warming, changing climates, erratic weather, acidifying oceans, disease pandemics, species endangerment and extinction, bioaccumulation of toxins and the overwhelming physical impact of exponentially-expanding human development **will have its correlates in human physical and mental distress. I have written about [solastalgia](https://theconversation.com/the-age-of-solastalgia-8337) or the lived experience of negative environmental change as one emergent form of mental distress** (Albrecht 2012a, Albrecht 2012b).
> **We need to get rid of the foundations of the concept of the Anthropocene** before it covers many more decades of history of Earth. If all of the above are the outcome of human dominance of the planet, then I do not wish to be identified with The Anthropocene. **I want this period in history to become redundant as soon as possible since, the longer it prevails, the more likely we will suffer catastrophic failure as a species here on Earth**. While this would be **a tragedy** of huge proportion for humans, **we will take with us thousands, perhaps millions, of other species as well**. Popular literature and film already portray such an apocalyptic turn in human-nature relationships.
> While we have **already tried to build** a new and viable society **around concepts** such as democracy, **sustainability, sustainable development and resilience**, all these **terms have been corrupted by forces determined to incorporate** and embed them into the Anthropocene where **they become ‘business as usual’**. **‘Sustainability’ is inadequate as a concept** because it **does not specify what is to be sustained** and over what time frame it is to be sustained. **‘Sustainable development’**, equally, **fails to define what it is about development that is to be sustained … except perhaps, development itself** (Albrecht 1994). **Yet, global-scale development** which is diametrically opposed to micro-life and planetary-scale forces **puts us on the path to dislocation then extinction**.
> … In order to counter all these negative trends within The Anthropocene we clearly need, within popular politics and culture, visions and memes of a different future. To get the detail into these visions, **we will need more novel conceptual development**, since **the foundation on which we are building right now is seriously flawed** and conducive of nothing but great waves of ennui, grief, dread, solastalgia, mourning and melancholia. **We must rapidly exit The Anthropocene** with its non-sustainability, perverse resilience, authoritarianism and its corrumpalism. **The new foundation, built around a new meme, will need to be an act of positive creation**.
> … **I argue that the next era in human history should be The Symbiocene (from the Greek sumbiosis, or companionship)**. The scientific meaning of **the word ‘symbiosis’ implies living together for mutual benefit** and I wish to use this profoundly important concept as **the basis for what I hope will be the next period of Earth history**. As a core aspect of ecological and evolutionary thinking, symbiosis and its associated symbiogenesis, **affirms the interconnectedness of life and all living things** (Scofield and Margulis 2012).

The meaning is clear even if you don’t understand every word.  (Albrecht makes skilled use of big words, some scientific and some of his own invention; a favorite of mine is “corrumpalism“, the politico-economic system where elites and corporations “use their power and influence to buy policy and manipulate or minimise regulation”; created from the Latin corrumpere, “to destroy”.)

The meaning is: if we created this geological epoch, we have the capacity to transcend it.  And, as our lives depend on it, it is imperative that we do so.  Trading in the Anthropocene for the Symbiocene would mean trading in outdated concepts for ones with new vibrancy, applicability, efficiency and truth — even challenging the outdated notions of interspecies competition in a fundamental way.  Albrecht writes:

> We are now closer to understanding how **ecosystem parameters can be guided by key players** in the system to **maximise benefits for the life-chances of whole species**. In essence, **there is a form of ‘natural justice’ that prevails**. We now know that, for example, **health in all forest ecosystems is regulated by what are called “[mother trees](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-networked-beauty-of-forests-suzanne-simard)” that control fungal networks that in turn interconnect trees** of varying ages. The control **system works to regulate nutrient flows to trees**, such as to the very young, **that need them most** ([Simard et al 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/272567309_Resource_transfer_between_plants_through_ectomycorrhizal_fungal_networks)). It **also works to transfer information and energy from dying species** to those that might continue to thrive, thus **maintaining ‘the forest’** (see [Fraser 2015](http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/artful-amoeba/dying-trees-can-send-food-to-neighbors-of-different-species/)). **These crucially important insights have yet to be incorporated into ecological thinking applied to politics and human societies**.

Suzanne Simard’s work on forest fungal networks that Albrecht cites above is fascinating and well worth a look, especially her [short and accessible TED Ed talk](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/the-networked-beauty-of-forests-suzanne-simard).

In short, whenever we look slightly beneath the surface of everyday life, we see the evidence for what Albrecht once called “[the age of solastalgia](https://theconversation.com/the-age-of-solastalgia-8337)“; heaps and mounds of evidence showing how we have mistreated the planet to the detriment of the Earth, our children, and our children’s children.  Among other subtle tragedies, one of the North America’s greatest rivers has been landlocked by human greed and overconsumption.

If humanity is to continue, this can not.

### Looking ahead

So, now with a new sense of urgency: What’s next?

A story on the Porter Ranch methane leak in Los Angeles County has been sorely needed for many weeks now, and I have been too slow in finishing it.  That project is on deck and should be out shortly, hopefully by the end of the week.

Fracking has also been on my mind recently, perhaps because examples of it lie closer in proximity to my own home in Michigan.  If I have digressed too many times lately on the subject, it is because a story is forthcoming.  Porter Ranch is on deck and fracking is in the hole.  Look for those two stories coming in the next few weeks.

Back to work!  Welcome home.

# Remember Sebring?  Removal of corrosion control caused crisis there, too

A few weeks ago we wrote here that Sebring, Ohio, a small town in rural northeast Ohio, was experiencing a “growing drinking water crisis”.  High levels of lead were found in the drinking water during “routine testing”, a local news source at the time reported.

At the time, based on [very good studies](http://flintwaterstudy.org/) of what had happened in Flint, we wondered if the problem in Sebring had something to do with a lack of corrosion control in the water.  At the time, officials [had said](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sebring-ohio-next-flint-water-crisis-lead-copper/):

> We are working with Sebring water treatment plant to make adjustments to minimize leaching of lead into the water

In Flint, one of the really fundamental problems was that the Emergency Manager and other non-elected officials had decided to get rid of corrosion control, which is adding chemicals called orthophosphates to the water, which form a plaque on the inside of water pipes to prevent corrosive water from dissolving lead pipes.  The managers of Flint knew what they were doing by neglecting corrosion control, and they said it was to save money.

Sebring’s problems look exactly like the early days of the Flint water crisis.  So we predicted that sooner or later someone would reveal that Sebring had been neglecting corrosion control as well:

> It also warrants at least asking the question — were corrosion control measures in place in the Sebring water system before high lead was found in the drinking water?  What were those measures?

Well, the question was warranted.  Last Wednesday, the Youngstown Vindicator reported that the city of Sebring would “begin” a program of flushing their water pipes.

What is the purpose of the program?  The Vindicator reports:

> The flushing is being done to **facilitate the distribution of orthophosphate, a new corrosion-control chemical**, throughout the system to reduce the possibility of lead leaching

There it is.  Orthophosphate is required to prevent the leaching of lead from water pipes into water supplies, and in Sebring’s system, it is a “new” addition; i.e., they didn’t have adequate corrosion control in place before their lead crisis.  

Also, according to the same report, “bottled-water distribution” has begun in the town.

In addition, as we talked about the last time we wrote about Sebring, it took a *very* long time for the high lead levels to be reported to citizens.  The same was true in Flint, where state-appointed officials in power delayed talking about the successive water crises because it would have been inconvenient for them to do so.  [The Fiscal Times reports](http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/02/28/Flint-One-Many-Lead-Polluted-Water-Systems-US):

> …**routine laboratory tests last August** in Sebring, Ohio, turned up unsafe levels of lead in the town’s drinking water after workers stopped adding a chemical to keep lead water pipes from corroding, according to The New York Times. **It took five months before city officials warned pregnant women and children not to drink the water and to shut down taps and drinking fountains in the schools**.

Like we said last time, keep an eye on Sebring.  It’s an echo of the same forces that caused the Flint tragedy.  Our thoughts are with the families who are suffering.

# Privatization and profits at the expense of people: Flint in perspective

### Flashback

It’s April 25, 2014.  Flint, Michigan, had just made the ill-fated switch from clean, pure Lake Huron-sourced drinking water pumped through the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) regional supply system, to full-time use of a backup system — the Flint River — which had sat idle ever since 1964 ([when a corruption scandal over the construction of a Lake Huron pipeline](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2012/11/ghosts_of_corruption_still_lin.html) led the city to sign a contract with DWSD for drinking water).  Then-Mayor Dayne Walling is the one officially commencing the switch to emergency-backup river water.  When he [presses the button cutting off DWSD supply](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/04/closing_the_valve_on_history_f.html), the small group of high-level officials crammed into a small out-building of the Flint Water Treatment Plant breaks out in celebration.

￼![](press%20the%20button.jpg)  
Ex-Mayor Dayne Walling cuts off the DWSD feed on April 25, 2014. Pic from Sam Wilson, MLive

Let’s not forget what ex-Mayor Walling said on that occasion, as well.  His words:
> “There have been a lot of questions from our customers because this is such a major change.
> …[but](#) when the treated river water starts being pumped into the system, we move from plan to reality. **The water quality speaks for itself**.”

**The water quality speaks for itself**.  Anyone who noticed the news coming out of Flint in the days, weeks, months, and years since those fateful words will understand how laughable, and yet completely accurate, ex-Mayor Walling’s comments were.

The water quality did speak for itself.  The water, which corroded Flint’s lead pipes due to its inherent corrosiveness as well as the city’s decision to forego safety measures, [was poisonous](http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/who-poisoned-flint-michigan-20160122).

### Perspective

Dayne Walling lost his November 2015 re-election to Karen Weaver.  Weaver, Flint’s first female mayor, and a Flint native who campaigned hard on the water issue, beat Walling decisively in the election, 55% to 43%.

These days, with current pressures lifted from his shoulders, Walling has turned to rehashing the early days of the crisis.  Recently, he was [interviewed by news source ThinkProgress](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/02/10/3747686/flint-dayne-walling/), whose coverage of the Flint debacle was harshly critical of the city and the State of Michigan as the crisis unfolded.  Bryce Covert of ThinkProgress immediately asked him to reflect on that infamous statement — “The water quality speaks for itself.”

Walling’s response was perfectly measured, (unlike the lead levels in the city’s water during his tenure):

> “**It’s humiliating**,” **he said, recalling his encouraging words** in an interview with ThinkProgress. “It’s hard to think back, knowing what I do now about lead levels rising in the water supply, and having made those those kinds of comments.”
> “**I could have never made those comments given what I know now**,” he continued. “**But I can’t forgive myself that I made them anyway**.”

Walling claims that he knew nothing about the health risks of the new drinking water source until much later – “red flags”, he said, didn’t start to go off until September 2014, when high levels of a carcinogenic disinfection byproduct, THM, were measured in the water:

> “**The red flag started waving for me with the TTHM (*advisory*)** and understanding that **I had not been given very basic information** from the tests,” he said. **He went to a meeting with the Department of Environmental Quality and other officials**, and realized, “I’m looking around the room and **everybody, the director of public works, the emergency manager, everybody knows what’s going on but me**.”

City residents were sent an [EPA form letter](http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-04/documents/pn_tthm_haa5_mcl.pdf) saying that their drinking water had been found to have [too many trihalomethanes](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/01/flint_water_has_high_disinfect.html) (a disinfection byproduct caused by the reaction of organic matter with chlorine disinfectants) months later, in January 2015.

Anxious to do something, but with limited power — remember, Michigan’s Emergency Manager law, Public Act 436 (2012) usurps local control from locally elected officials and puts it in the hands of unelected Emergency Managers appointed by the Governor — Walling drafted a “Flint Water Improvement Plan” and sent it to Governor Snyder.  [The plan](https://www.cityofflint.com/wp-content/uploads/Flint-Mayor-Water-Request.pdf) requested $50 million to fund objectives falling under categories such as “Safety & Quality”, “Access”, “Investment”, and “Education”.

His plan was “blown off” as an attempt to win votes in an election year, Walling says (and to be perfectly fair, it was pretty obviously also that).  But the Snyder administration blew off the larger problem too, producing only $2 million worth of grant funding.  Just a few months prior, [in March 2015](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/03/flint_water_consultant_final_r.html), Veolia North America, an independent “water consulting corporation” had estimated that necessary improvements to just the Flint Water Treatment Plant would total about $3 million dollars, meaning the grant the Snyder administration had so generously provided the city would not even fully address the inadequacies of the water treatment plant, let alone the wider problem, which did not originate from the plant but rather from the distribution system.

Walling heavily emphasizes that the city should have “reached out” and accepted outside help from the beginning.  But his words are slightly disingenuous for two reasons.

The first reason is that genuine, expert help from outside was present, available, and eager to help almost from the outset of the crisis.  Miguel del Toral, a federal EPA regulator, was on board to investigate reports of high lead in Flint residents’ water as early as February 2015.  Marc Edwards of Virginia Tech, a MacArthur Fellow and drinking water contamination expert, was on the case in April 2015, on del Toral’s recommendation.  [This article from FlintWaterStudy.org](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/09/commentary-mdeq-mistakes-deception-flint-water-crisis/) (especially under headings “Phase 3” and “Phase 4”) confirms this.  However, while these two experts were beginning to confirm the suspicions of Flint residents that they were being poisoned, Walling was still hemming and hawing about whether there was a widespread problem.  The ThinkProgress article reports:

> **Walling met with LeAnne Walters**, one of the most vocal residents who brought attention to the contamination, **and heard about the elevated levels of lead** in her water. **He was told, he says, that the problem was that her house was connected to an unusually long lead service line**, which was causing the problem. “** ** was that yes, that lead line was part of the problem, but **that there was an underlying issue of corrosion**,” he said.

Are you kidding??  Even if Walters’ house had an “unusually long lead service line”, what would be causing that line to leech lead into the house’s drinking water?  The only logical answer, *even from only that information given*, is corrosion.  Walling’s words are disingenuous to the point of falsity.

The second reason Walling is being disingenuous when he says that the city should have “reached out” for expert help earlier, is that the city *did* in fact do just that.  The problem isn’t the city’s lack of expert opinion.  The problem is *who* the city hired to be their “experts”.

In this case, the city’s water consultant, hired by the office of the Emergency Manager (in between the terms of Darnell Earley and Jerry Ambrose) on February 10, 2015, was a company called [Veolia Water North America](https://www.cityofflint.com/2015/02/10/flint-hires-international-urban-water-experts-of-veolia-north-america-to-assess-citys-water-issues/).

Ex-Mayor Walling was influenced by Veolia’s assessment and recommendations:

> When Walling made the comments he now regrets, **Veolia, a private multinational water company that had been [brought in](http://www.michigan.gov/documents/snyder/FlintWaterTimeline_FINAL_511424_7.pdf) to do an independent assessment, told the city that it met state and federal water standards**, although it didn’t report on lead levels.
> “**My understanding** was that…**we had a TTHM** (*trihalomethanes, which can cause liver and kidney damage*) problem…that **all the steps that everybody was saying we needed to take we were taking**,” (*Walling*) said. “I didn’t want people to be unnecessarily afraid. And **the tragedy is that everyone in this community had a real fear of lead that should have been there from the beginning**.”

When you [read Veolia’s water quality report](https://www.cityofflint.com/wp-content/uploads/Veolia-REPORT-Flint-Water-Quality-201503121.pdf) to the city from March 2013, it’s clear that the company is either simply incompetent, or willfully ignorant of the lead problem, focusing instead on THM contamination as the primary concern.  From the report:

> Although the primary focus of this review was based on solving the TTHM problem, the public has also expressed its frustration over discolored and hard water. Those aesthetic issues have understandably increased the level of concern about the safety of the water.

By the way, lead is not an “aesthetic issue”.  You can’t see it, taste it, or smell it.  It just poisons you silently.

But we can see clearly from Walling’s own admission and Veolia’s own report that the ex-Mayor’s knowledge of the issue was almost entirely informed by the information Veolia was feeding him.

So what is Veolia Water, anyway?

[Veolia Environnement](http://www.veolia.com/en) is Veolia Water North America’s parent company.  It is a multi-national corporation spun off from French corporation Vivendi Universal (formerly Compagnie Generale des Eaux — the General Water Company) and renamed Veolia Environement in 2002, after the board of directors of Vivendi faced charges of corruption in 1996.  Along with Suez Environnement, another French company, Veolia is one of a handful of major corporations that control the global market for privatized water.  [Human rights organization Global Exchange](http://www.globalexchange.org/economicactivism/veolia/otheroffenses) calls Veolia “**the largest water privatization business in the world**“.

Global Exchange is not alone in its appraisal of Veolia Water.  A [2005 study by the Polaris Institute](https://d3n8a8pro7vhmx.cloudfront.net/polarisinstitute/pages/29/attachments/original/1410802217/veoliapdf.pdf?1410802217) finds that “Veolia Environment (VE) **profits from pro-privatization policies**“, “VE makes money managing privatized water utilities and it is **in their interest to influence governments and institutions to privatize public services**“, and “(*Veolia*) has also been **charged with corruption, bribery and anti-competitive business practices** on a number of occasions”.

More organizations chime in to submit their stories of Veolia’s mismanagement of municipal water systems.  A joint study by the Canadian Union of Public Employees (the [country’s largest union, representing 627,000 as of May 2013](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Union_of_Public_Employees)) and the Polaris Institute from 2014, [found several episodes of fraud, willful environmental degradation, and mistreating customers](https://cupe.ca/sites/cupe/files/veolia_e.pdf).  In February 2004, the town of Rockland, Massachusetts, “**terminated its 10-year $1.2 million contract with USFilter (now Veolia Water)** to run the town’s sewage treatment plant **on the advice of the state Office of the Inspector General** amid **charges of embezzlement and fraud**“.  According to the report, a US District Court Judge found Veolia to have “acted unfairly and deceptively” in “colluding” with a local official to win the Rockland contract.  In New Orleans, Louisiana, the study found that “**USFilter (now Veolia Water), which runs two wastewater treatment plants** in the city, has **racked up US$107,000 in fines for discharging sewage directly into the Mississippi River 64 times** since 2001.”  And in Indianapolis, a city where Veolia fully operated the entire water system, the city was inundated with complaints about the company, including: “habitually **overcharging** customers; **overestimating water usage**; large **rate increases**; **lax oversight** of the company by the city”.  Indianapolis officials were ultimately pressured to “**terminate its contract with the company** and **shift the ownership and operation** of the water and wastewater utilities **to a charitable trust**“.

Food and Water Watch, in a [2013 publication](http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/sites/default/files/Veolia%20Water%20Profile%20FS%20Aug%202013.pdf), gives more detail on Veolia Water’s Indianapolis contract, which it described as the company’s “crown jewel in the United States”:

> **Consumers**: Within a year, **thousands of residents experienced billing problems**, and consumer complaints more than doubled. **In 2005, because the company lacked proper safeguards, an error caused a boil-water alert** for more than a million people, closing local businesses and canceling school for 40,000 students. Three years later, numerous **consumer complaints prompted a state agency to begin an informal probe into the company’s meter reading, and residents sued the company for allegedly using unfair billing practices and overcharging them**. In 2011, a resident filed **another lawsuit accusing the company of improper service shut-offs**. …
> **Workers**: **Non-union employees immediately lost their pensions** and saw other benefit cuts, which **they said would cost them more than $50 million over 25 years**. Two years later, **the company slashed the nonunion workforce by about 15 percent**, prompting worries about **lost expertise**. Meanwhile, the labor union sued the company for refusing to arbitrate several grievances, and unionized employees nearly went on strike when the company tried to take away their pensions and cut their medical benefits. In total, from 2001 to 2008, 92 water jobs — 19 percent of the workforce — were lost. **The state also fined Veolia for a serious occupational safety and health violation in 2010**.
> … **City**: **By 2005, several city officials were calling for a performance audit** of the company. **One city council member accused the company of cutting back on staffing, water testing, treatment and maintenance**, and other council members questioned whether the company **had a financial incentive to fudge quality tests**. That year, a **federal grand jury even subpoenaed four Veolia managers** as part of an investigation into allegations that the **utility falsified water quality reports**, although this investigation resulted in **no charges**.

Another gem hidden in the Food and Water Watch report is an example of mismanagement that is explicitly related to water quality.  In Gladewater, Texas, a community that Veolia had acquired a contract to manage in 1996, “**the system had violated federal water quality standards 16 times since 2004, and residents described the water as ‘dark brown’ and ‘foul’**“, the Food and Water Watch states.

Finally, the Food and Water Watch factsheet lays out Veolia’s current marketing scheme, a playbook that they are clearly using in Flint:

> In 2011, still struggling to grow and **unable to convince big cities to privatize, Veolia switched to pursuing consulting deals** through a business model that it branded “Peer Performance Solutions.” **In these contracts, the company recommends ways for a city to cut costs or increase revenue**. The model differs from a traditional consulting contract in that **instead of just receiving a fixed fee for its work, Veolia also gets a share of the money generated from its recommendations**. Although this revenue-sharing model is touted as new and pioneering, United Water — owned by Veolia’s competitor and fellow Parisian company Suez Environnement — attempted a very similar structure a decade ago.

So this is the water “expert” that Dayne Walling, the city of Flint, the Flint Emergency Manager’s office, and the Rick Snyder’s office were listening to: Veolia Water, the largest water privatization business in the world, one that routinely faces allegations of overcharging customers, fudging water quality tests, and treating the environment with contempt.  Not only were they the government’s “expert” on water, but they were the sole scientific source that state officials were giving any credence to.  We covered this in our first cover story about Flint, so I won’t bore you with the details again.  Suffice it to say that not only the Flint Emergency Manager’s office, but state officials at the Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) and the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), and the Governor’s office; all preferred stonewalling and smearing the efforts of real scientists like Dr. Marc Edwards of Virginia Tech and Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha of Hurley Medical Center than admitting they had a problem on their hands.  Apparently, all the while, they were sucking at Veolia’s teat, too.

Because these supposed leaders spent so much time and effort denying that there was a problem, chronic issues persist in Flint.  The most important one is that [high lead levels persist in the city’s water](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/02/high_lead_levels_still_being_f.html):

https://www.google.com/maps/d/viewer?mid=18K7xOGsr39zzgkZ88bums0dMIz8&usp=sharing

From the same article, MLive reports that:

> Roughly **9,300 water tests have been conducted as of Feb. 13**, according to the state. **More than 600 of those tests have revealed lead concentrations above the 15 ppb federal action limit**.
> … Nearly **250 tests done so far this month have returned levels above 15 ppb, including 67 in the past week**.
> … **Eleven of the tests returned rates above 150 ppb**, which officials warn would make **faucet filters insufficient to remove the contaminant**.

The article also states that, “As of Feb. 5, **63 children under age 18 have tested positive for blood lead levels** greater than or equal to 5 mcg/dL since October 1, 2015″, and “officials have also confirmed they are looking into [a possible link](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/02/doctor_who_exposed_blood_lead.html) between **miscarriages and elevated blood lead levels** in the city.”

Not only that, but now the person with the highest, ever, recorded blood lead level in the county is a Flint resident, and his BLL is 5x the level considered “toxic”.  [The Detroit Free Press reports](http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/02/17/lead-flint-mans-blood-5-times-whats-toxic/80507268/):

> **(*Aaron*) Stinson, 39**, said Genesee County Health Department officials told him a Feb. 4 test showed **he has the highest lead-blood levels of any adult that has been tested in the county to date**. Stinson’s results, reviewed by the Free Press, revealed that he has **blood-lead levels of 27 micrograms per deciliter of blood (27 ug/dl), five times the level considered toxic**.
> … “**I was having the symptoms, thinking it was maybe something I ate**,” Stinson recalled. “Or maybe I’ve been working too much or moving around too much. I went down there (to the county health department), **took the test on the fourth of February, and got a call back on the seventh, and she said she was concerned about my blood-lead levels**.
> “At the time, **I didn’t understand what that meant fully**. I understood that lead was bad for you, but **I didn’t understand the ramifications of it or how serious it was** or what it really meant until she started explaining it. She said **the average adult … tested had a level of one or two**.”
> … **Holding two lead- and copper-level test results** in his hand from January that **showed water in his home was safe to drink**, Stinson said he’s frustrated.
> “**I received letters in the mail telling me my water meets the state qualifications** as being safe enough to consume, **but I can tell you there’s not a state lawmaker in Lansing or anywhere else who would drink just a tiny cup of Flint water out of that tap right now**, and that’s where my issue lies,” he said. “If they can come down from Lansing, run my water and drink a full glass of water from the tap, maybe I’ll believe it’s safe.”

There is extensive scientific consensus that lead poisoning is terrible for adults as well as children.  Evidence is also emerging about a connection between lead poisoning and the development of Parkinson’s disease.  Again from the Free Press:

> Henry Ford Health System **neurologist Peter LeWitt said adults exposed to lead poisoning can suffer from anemia, neurotrophy** — which causes weakness, numbness or pain due to **nerve damage — brain swelling, and even death**.
> … LeWitt said a wealth of research has been conducted on the impact lead poisoning can have on adults, specifically **a potential link to Parkinson’s disease**.

It goes without saying that lead poisoning of Flint residents should have been, and should currently be, a priority for city and state (probably also national) lawmakers and officials.  However, when asked about Stinson’s case, the state of Michigan’s Chief Medical Executive’s response was troublingly passive:

> **Dr. Eden Wells**, the state’s chief medical executive, said that while **she doesn’t know anything specific about Stinson’s case**, a blood-lead level as high as 27 **would definitely “perk her ears.”**
> “**When you see that, you always want to make sure that individual is following up**” by routinely seeing a physician, Wells said.

In other words, Ms. Eden Wells had no idea about Stinson (the person who had been the most poisoned by this crisis for which she was partially responsible), until she was asked.

Very clearly, Dayne Walling is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to governmental incompetence during the crisis.  The real problem is at the state government level, which includes MDEQ, DHHS, the Emergency Managers, and the Governor’s office.  (Due to the Public Act 436, remember, Flint is managed at the state level with little to no local control over local issues — this includes over the water system.)

The state’s penchant for misleading the public and denying the problem is well documented, because Freedom of Information Act requests and voluntary releases by state employees (including the Governor’s office) have provided the public with a good number of emails regarding the crisis.  [The Detroit Free Press documented](http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/flint-water-crisis/2016/02/19/flint-water-crisis-emails/80228582/) some of the most offending emails in an article dated February 20, 2016.

In April 2014, an email from the water quality supervisor at the Water Treatment Plant sent to an official at MDEQ clearly states that the city’s desire to switch to the Flint River source on April 25 would be too early, because the plant was not fully equipped and staff not fully trained:

> “I do not anticipate giving the OK to begin sending water out any time soon. **If water is distributed from this plant in the next couple of weeks, it will be against my direction**. **I need time to** adequately **train additional staff** and to **update our monitoring plans** before I will feel we are ready.”  
> -Mike Glasgow

Then in October 2014, an email from a disease specialist at the state Department of Health and Human Services, sent to her colleagues at DHHS, clearly indicates that Liane Shekter Smith, MDEQ’s drinking water specialist, had tried to keep her from publicizing the fact that an outbreak of Legionnaire’s disease had been linked to the Flint River-sourced water:

> “What she did share with me was interesting — that **there have been numerous complaints** about the Flint water, that **the governor’s office had been involved**, and that **any announcement by public health about the quality of the water would certainly inflame the situation**.”  
> -Susan Bohm

A couple more emails from the Free Press article are worth reprinting.  In April 2015, emails from MDEQ’s Patrick Cook to his MDEQ colleagues Stephen Busch and Mike Prysby, indicate that MDEQ knew that corrosion control was required, and that Flint was not in compliance with that requirement:

> “**I knew this was going to happen. Miguel is questioning that Flint is in compliance with optimal corrosion control**” (…) “Please read the below e-mail and let me know what you think. While **it’s not a big hurry** at this time since Miguel is out till next week, **we eventually will have to respond to him**.”  
> -Patrick Cook

And in the same month (April 2015) an email from the CDC shows that the Legionnaire’s outbreak that Liane Shekter Smith wanted to keep Susan Bohm quiet about (above), was actually even worse than previously thought:

> “**We are very concerned about this Legionnaires’ disease outbreak**. It’s very large, **one of the largest we know of in the past decade**, and community-wide, and in our opinion and experience **it needs a comprehensive investigation**.”  
> –Laurel Garrison, CDC

And there is no better way to summarize these emails (and the actions of state-level officials in general) than with this email sent by a Genesee County environmental health supervisor who spent months trying to get MDEQ to send him documents that should have been publicly available through the Freedom of Information Act:

> “MDEQ reminds me of a stubborn 2yr old child. Instead of doing what is right, they’ll willfully take another spanking just to be defiant.”  
> -James Henry

“Willful defiance” sums it up pretty well, thanks.

And the defiance continues to this day.  As of February 22, 2016, the Snyder administration has “refused” federal-level requests for documents relating to the crisis, ThinkProgress reports:
> On January 26, Democratic **Reps. Elijah Cummings** (MD) and **Brenda Lawrence** (MI) sent a letter **to Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder** (R) **requesting a number of documents related to the current water crisis** in Flint. But **his office has “completely ignored” that request so far**, Cummings said in a letter on Monday.
> … In their original request, Cummings and Lawrence **gave Snyder’s office a deadline of February 11**, but in Monday’s letter, Cummings noted **Snyder’s “blatant refusal to cooperate.”** The **governor’s office did not return a request for comment as to why the documents haven’t been released or whether he plans to cooperate**.

Snyder has released some emails from his office dating from 2014 and 2015, but his current refusal means that he is protecting emails about the drinking water sent and received by the Governor, the Treasurer, the Emergency Manager and all their staff beginning in January 2013, emails about water quality complaints sent to all relevant agencies beginning in April 2014, and emails about the decision to switch to the Flint River going back to January 2011.  As we have reported before at Solastalgia, USA, these time frames are when the decisions were made — 2014 and 2015 were the aftermath.  For example, [the decision to switch to the Flint River as a drinking water source was made in June 2013 by former Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz](http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/michigan/files/201512/water_plan_resolution.pdf?_ga=1.2902898.392165409.1450095903).  So the Governor’s refusal to turn over these documents to a federal investigation is actually just an attempt to cover his own ass.

[ThinkProgress agrees](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/02/22/3752027/snyder-flint-documents-refusal/):

> There may be some **reason to suspect there is important information in the documents that have yet to be released**. [Emails obtained](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/02/11/3748530/snyder-emails-lead-tests-delay/) by the Flint Journal sent by city health officials in April 2014 showed that they were concerned that **Snyder’s administration purposefully delayed the results of lead testing in the schools’ drinking water twice**. A [different email exchange](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/02/11/3748530/snyder-emails-lead-tests-delay/) between a principal Snyder adviser and an official the DEQ obtained by Progress Michigan indicated that the **administration was made aware of a significant uptake in Legionnaires outbreaks in March 2015, potentially related to the water switch, even though Snyder previously said he wasn’t made aware until early this year**. And [yet other emails](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2016/01/28/3743987/flint-water-state-employees/) obtained by Progress Michigan showed that **a state agency brought water coolers into a state building in Flint in January of 2015** out of concern over water quality, **a year before bottled water was made available to residents**.

I’m sure the United State Environmental Protection Agency, had they been so clever, would have described the state response to the Flint tragedy as “willful defiance” too.  [Instead, they settled for calling it “inadequate”](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/20/flint-water-crisis-epa-inadequate-response), The Guardian reports:

> In a [letter](http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-02/documents/epa_letter_to_mdeq_and_city_of_flint_w_attachments_2.19.16.pdf) to the Michigan department of environmental quality (MDEQ), **Mark Pollins, director of the EPA’s water enforcement division**, said **Flint has “not yet demonstrated that it has an adequate number of qualified personnel” to ensure safe drinking water standards** are maintained.
> Alongside the **“inadequate” staffing situation**, Pollins said **state and city had failed to put together a proper plan to deal with the crisis** since federal intervention in January.
> … An **attached memo from Pollins, dated 8 February, cited 11 “deficiencies” in the state and city response**, including the **failure to properly treat drinking water** for lead corrosion, a **lack of daily water monitoring** and the **failure to provide data** on the amount of lead in water since January 2013.
> Pollins also **criticized a substandard inventory of Flint homes with lead water pipes** and the lack of certainty that Flint’s water treatment plant is doing its job properly.

Not only that, but [MLive reports that the EPA had identified problems with the way MDEQ conducted its business as far back as 2010](http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/02/signs_of_trouble_at_mdeq_years.html):

> **Years before** a lead-poisoning crisis made Flint an unenviable center of national attention, **there were warning signs about the state agency** charged with keeping drinking water safe.
> … In 2010, a [federal audit](http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/documents/program-review-mdeq-water-bureau-20100830-76pp_0.pdf) **portrayed MDEQ as a department beset by budget cuts, staff shifts and limited resources, and willing to take regulatory shortcuts** in safeguarding Michigan’s water.

That audit was [conducted for the EPA](http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-11/documents/program-review-mdeq-water-bureau-20100830-76pp_0.pdf) by the consulting firm The Cadmus Group and included some troubling signs, such as:

> While (*the practice of **filling vacancies with staff from other programs** that have been cut or eliminated*) preserves jobs, it **decreases the technical knowledge of staff** and requires tremendous resources to train these staff…
> … **Frequent hiring freezes** have impacted Michigan for about ten years…This has **made it difficult to replace positions**.
> … **(*MDEQ*) does not calculate 90th percentiles** (*for lead*), **unless one sample exceeds one-half of the (*15 ppb*) action level**. In that case, a potential violation will be identified and staff will use (*a state database*) to calculate the 90th percentile… **(*this*) practice does not meet the requirements of Federal Regulations**, since it is required that all 90th percentiles be calculated.

But with all this procedural wrongdoing from MDEQ, Flint’s Emergency Managers, the Governor’s office, and others, it’s easy to lose sight of the bigger picture.  We need to find the forest for the trees.

We should remind ourselves that Flint residents are paying the highest water rates in the country for water — even though their water is poison.

We should remind ourselves that the Executive Director of the policy research center In The Public Interest has expressed his concern that the Flint water crisis is an opening for privatization.

![](huffpo%20opening%20for%20privatization.png)￼  
Source: Huffington Post

We should remind ourselves that on September 9, 2014, the city of Detroit, itself under Emergency Manager rule, signed an agreement to create a corporatized “Great Lakes Water Authority” to serve the city’s residents.  This agreement has been widely interpreted as the first step to privatization, [including by Food and Water Watch](http://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/news/detroits-new-regional-water-authority-prelude-privatization):

> **A reading of the agreement reveals that it will likely lead to the privatization of the water system**.
> The creation of the regional authority, the Great Lakes Water Authority, **corporatizes the system by putting appointed, unelected officials fully in charge** of the big decisions that determine the cost and quality of service. **The agreement treats water provision as a business instead of a public service. Corporatization itself is the first step to privatization.** The **new authority can privatize** the management and operation of the water and sewer system **without real city input or public approval**.

The Wall Street Journal just comes out and says it, in a March 25, 2014 article:

> DETROIT – This **bankrupt city** is **seeking proposals from private companies to run and potentially buy its regional water and sewer system** as talks to lease it to the city’s suburbs have stalled.

A jovial press clipping from the Detroit News [archived at an industry website for water privateers](http://www.waterindustry.org/New%20Projects/Detroit-rates-4.htm) repeats industry claims that privatization is cheaper for consumers and states than public water systems (a claim easily refuted if you ask the citizens of Indianapolis about their experiences, or read above), and asks: “Is privatization an answer?”

According to some, Detroit has already jumped on the privatization bandwagon.  According to Erin Diaz of Corporate Accountability International, which published [this white paper](http://www.stopcorporateabuse.org/sites/default/files/resources/cai_troubledwaters_whitepaper_webres.pdf) outlining the mounting pressure to privatize public water systems, widely-reported water shutoffs and rate hikes in Detroit are the [standard opening gambits of water privatization](http://america.aljazeera.com/opinions/2014/6/detroit-public-watershutoffsunitednationsprivatization.html):

> “The **rate hikes and service cutoffs** we’re seeing in Detroit, while uncharacteristic of public water systems, **are actually a very real glimpse into what the city’s system could be like if privatized — we’ve seen it all over the world**.”

By all accounts, the private water company most likely to get the Detroit contract is Veolia Water, which [has already completed a review of Detroit Water and Sewerage Department assets](http://www.dwsd.org/downloads_n/about_dwsd/TransitionPlan/DWSD_response_to_Veolia_Peer_Review.pdf).

But let’s not get too wrapped up in what could be happening in Detroit, even if everyone that knows what they’re talking about, from the Wall Street Journal to Food and Water Watch, thinks that it’s happening.

Let’s talk instead about an egregious case of water privatization that is actually going on, right now.

In 2001 and 2002 MDEQ issued permits to Nestle, the bottled water company, to set up its “Ice Mountain” bottling plant in Mecosta County, MI.  The Nestle plant bottles water drawn from local wells — *for free* — and sells it at a profit.  [Democracy Now! reports](http://www.democracynow.org/2016/2/17/michigans_water_wars_nestle_pumps_millions):

> In 2001 and 2002, the **Michigan Department of Environmental Quality issued permits to Nestlé**, the largest water bottling company in the world, **to pump up to 400 gallons of water per minute from aquifers that feed Lake Michigan**. This sparked a decade-long legal battle between Nestlé and the residents of Mecosta County, Michigan, where Nestlé’s wells are located. **One of the most surprising things about this story is that, in Mecosta County, Nestlé is not required to pay anything to extract the water**, besides **a small permitting fee** to the state and the cost of **leases to a private landowner**. In fact, **the company received $13 million in tax breaks from the state** to locate the plant in Michigan. The **spokesperson for Nestlé in Michigan is Deborah Muchmore. She’s the wife of Dennis Muchmore—Governor Rick Snyder’s chief of staff**, who just retired and registered to be a lobbyist.

So let’s get this straight:

Flint residents are paying out of the nose for poison water from the tap.

Nestle is getting rich off of free Lake Michigan water.

And when Snyder finally declared a state of emergency in Flint (at least a year after he should have), what did the National Guard hand out?

Cases of Ice Mountain Nestle bottled water.

# Don’t shit on other people’s stuff

You might think this advice goes without saying.  You might think that.

What most people don’t automatically think about, however, is that every patch of ground they walk over on the American continents was once the living, planting, hunting and sacred lands of pre-Columbian civilizations.  As Europeans and later Americans (mostly white &of European descent) colonized and settled the interior of the continent, they slaughtered most of the native inhabitants and shoved the rest onto tiny plots of less-valuable land so that the white guys could get the best stuff for themselves.

Malheur National Wilderness Refuge in eastern Oregon used to be one of these native reservations.  [Natives, especially of the Paiute tribe, have lived in the encompassing region for the past 15,000 to 16,000 years, according to archaeological evidence](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malheur_National_Wildlife_Refuge).  When white folks arrived in the area, a “Malheur Indian Reservation” was established, but the land included in that rez was slowly chipped away and given to white settlers for their own purposes.  After expressing their displeasure over this unfairness, the Paiute people were forced to resettle at a different reservation and their land was taken from them wholesale.

Instead of Malheur Indian Reservation, the US federal gov’t established a Malheur National Wilderness Refuge under President Theodore Roosevelt in 1908.  But the National Wilderness Refuge still contains the ancestral hunting, fishing, and burial lands of the Paiute people (so is it really a “wilderness”?, we might ask).  Incidentally, because the Wilderness Refuge was created in the name of protecting bird habitats, it does make one question the environmental ethics of Pres. Roosevelt…the suffering of people who lived with the land can be easily tossed aside, but let’s make very sure we prevent the suffering of ducks on that same land (especially if that means there are more ducks and land for white people!).

But anyway, you may have heard about the Malheur Wilderness Refuge lately because some armed bandits took refuge there recently in an anti-government rebellion. They were recently kicked out by federal intervention, but they left a lot of stuff behind.  Guns, ammunition, trash, and poop.  So much poop.

[Reuters reports](http://mobile.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0VQ09S):

> …the FBI on Friday said it was working with the Burns Paiute Tribe to identify damage to the tribe’s artifacts and sacred burial grounds at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge during the six-week occupation.
> …
> U.S. Attorney Billy Williams of Oregon wrote in the filing that investigators found “significant amounts of human feces” in a trench at an outdoor camping area that was either on or next to a “sensitive cultural site.”
> “Occupiers appear to have excavated two large trenches and an improvised road on or adjacent to grounds containing sensitive artifacts,” he wrote.

Gross.

Just so we’re clear, as we have established above. Malheur “Wilderness” Refuge is not a wilderness at all.  It is the ancestral lands of the Paiute people and has been for 16,000 years.  The moral equivalent of what the rebels did would be something like: camping overnight at a cemetery and shitting on all the headstones when you’ve gotta go.  Or getting drunk one night, wandering into a church, and pissing on all the pews.

Now, when you’re living outside, you’ve gotta do what you’ve gotta do.  But it seems very basic to try not to put your poop on something that someone else considers sacred.

Now, the real tragedy, of course, is that we, the USA, have slaughtered, imprisoned, kept in poverty, and ignored a whole population of real human beings, who happen to also safeguard a long tradition of caring for the land we walk on.

But sometimes you just have to speak from bare human decency.

Don’t shit on other people’s stuff.

# Manmade earthquakes shake fracking capital of Canada, too

If Oklahoma (which is currently experiencing [2.5 earthquakes every day](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/13/oklahoma-earthquakes-magnitude-fracking) that measure over 3.0 on the Richter scale) is the hydrofracking capital of the US, then Alberta Province, Canada, is the fracking capital of Canada.  Residents there are experiencing [an average of one earthquake per day](http://phys.org/news/2016-01-fracking-alberta-daily-quakes-thirsty.html), a development that official studies say has been “triggered by fluid injection during hydraulic fracturing”.

Just last month, on January 12, 2016, an earthquake measuring 4.8 on the Richter scale [shook the small town of Fox Creek, Alberta](http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/fox-creek-fracking-operation-closed-indefinitely-after-earthquake-1.3400605).  The quake was “unusually strong” and effects were felt as far as 280 km away from the epicenter.  Fossil fuel regulators have shut down one hydrofracking operation owned by Repsol Oil & Gas (35 miles away from Fox Creek). Why? It turns out that the Repsol Oil & Gas drilling unit was actually in the process of injecting fluids into the ground at the exact moment when the earthquake hit:

> In a statement, **Repsol confirmed the seismic event** and said **the company was conducting hydraulic fracturing operations at the time it happened**.

This is why this earthquake is unique. In most other cases of manmade earthquakes, the problem has been pegged (scapegoated, perhaps) on wastewater injection wells.  But this is not the case here.  Instead, [Canadian scientists are pretty sure that this quake was caused by fracking itself, not wastewater](http://insideclimatenews.org/news/05082015/alberta-earthquakes-tied-fracking-not-just-wastewater-injection-canada):

> **The difference between this one and many of the quakes felt in fracking country in the U.S., however, is that Canadian researchers are attributing the cause to fracking itself, not just the wastewater disposal process**.
> …there are some **key differences**. For one, **fracking-caused events likely occur more quickly after fluid injection**—on the order of hours to days to weeks. **Wastewater events, however, can occur months to years later**.
> Gu, Atkinson, and three other researchers found this to be the case in Fox Creek in 2013, when the area was struck by an unusually high number of earthquakes—more than 50 quakes in a four-month period. “**If you look at the time of the hydraulic fracturing of the operations, the timing of the earthquakes is closely related**,” said Atkinson.

So if we take this event in Alberta seriously, we have to admit that not only is wastewater injection **absolutely** causing earthquakes, but  the hydraulic fracturing process itself is likely doing the same.  There is no part of this process that is safe.

Besides the geologic instability, [water use by the fracking industry has crowded out the fresh water available to residents](http://phys.org/news/2016-01-fracking-alberta-daily-quakes-thirsty.html#jCp):

> “**Industry and the provincial government (of Alberta) have been turning a blind eye** to what has been going on in our area,” **Fox Creek Mayor** Jim Ahn said in a letter to the AER.
> “We have **industry pulling water from our rivers, streams and lakes at rates we feel far exceed their capabilities to replenish themselves**.”
> **Water shortages have become a persistent problem**, he said, adding that the **municipality had to spend more than Can$300,000 (US$206,000) to bring in potable water** for its residents.

When will we learn that we can live without oil, but we cannot live without water?

# People frack the earth, and she quakes in pain

Two earthquakes struck northern Oklahoma on Saturday (2/13/16).  The larger of the two was a 5.1 on the Richter scale. The smaller, which struck a mere 10 minutes after the first, measured 3.9, [The Guardian reports](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/13/oklahoma-earthquakes-magnitude-fracking).

The larger first quake could very well be the largest earthquake ever recorded in Oklahoma, upsetting the previous record set in 2011 for a quake that measured 5.6 on the Richter scale. As of right now, it is “not known” if the event was triggered by oil&gas drilling in the area.

However, [The Guardian report](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/13/oklahoma-earthquakes-magnitude-fracking) does remind us that Oklahoma has seen a definitive uptick in earthquakes in recent years that is most likely linked to drilling in the region:

> Oklahoma has seen a **surge in seismic activity** in recent years, which seismologists have said [may be linked to oil production activities](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/10/fracking-earthquakes-oklahoma-colorado-gas-companies).
> The state has been recording 2.5 earthquakes daily of a magnitude 3 or greater, **a rate 600 times greater than observed before 2008**, the Oklahoma Geological Survey said in a report last year.

And OilPrice.com informs us that Saturday’s quake was in the immediate vicinity of a lot of oil production:

> The **epicenter was near the East Campbell Gas Field** and **about 75 miles west of Cushing**—the “Pipeline Crossroads–and **one of the largest oil storage hubs in the world**.

Earthquakes are becoming more and more frequent in Oklahoma, which historically does not have many earthquakes. Just last month, two similar quakes struck rural northern Oklahoma, with epicenters near oil producing regions. [The Guardian reports](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/10/fracking-earthquakes-oklahoma-colorado-gas-companies) on January 10:

> [Last Wednesday night](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/jan/01/oklahoma-earthquakes-oil-gas-industry-wastewater-injection) two earthquakes, measuring 4.7 and 4.8 on the Richter scale, [struck](http://www.weather.com/news/news/oklahoma-earthquake-swarm-fairview-january-2016) rural northern Oklahoma, beneath a major oil and gas producing area. The state historically experiences two shakes a year registering above level three.

The number of earthquakes in Oklahoma, which is an epicenter of the US production of fossil fuels through hydrofracking, has been [steadily rising over the years](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/10/fracking-earthquakes-oklahoma-colorado-gas-companies):

> According to the National Earthquake Information Center (NEIC), which is based in Colorado, **in 2014 Oklahoma experienced 585 such quakes. In 2015 there were 842**.
> “**That’s almost a millennium’s worth of earthquakes in two years**,” George Choy, a seismologist at the center, told the Guardian on Friday. “**When you see that you suspect something is going on**.”
> … “**Water is finding its way to the underground faults** and there is always that **possibility of a big earthquake**. We are **certainly concerned**.”

Pamela Worth, [writing for the Union of Concerned Scientists](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pamela-worth/got-science-will-oklahoma_b_9195262.html), blames the practice of drilling injection wells to store fracking wastewater deep underground for the alarming increase in earthquakes in usually-tectonically-stable Oklahoma:

> **Until 2009, Oklahoma experienced an average of just two earthquakes per year** with a magnitude of 3.0 or more. But **that was before a dramatic increase in hydraulic fracturing** in the state led to **the drilling of thousands of deep injection wells to dispose of so-called wastewater**–the **brine or sludge collected with oil** in the hydraulic fracturing process. Unlike other wastewater associated with fracking, **this sludge cannot be reused**.
> Given the quantities involved, the **most economically feasible option** for oil and gas companies is to use gravity-fed wells to **pour it deep into the ground**, **beneath Oklahoma’s aquifers**. Just last year, **oil and gas companies in Oklahoma poured 1.5 billion barrels of this** wastewater sludge back underground–the equivalent of roughly **3 million swimming pools’ worth**.
> [Scientists say](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6241/1336) that **there’s little doubt that the more than 400-fold increase in earthquakes in Oklahoma in recent years has been induced by wastewater disposal**. And the U.S. Geological Survey [warns](http://www.news9.com/story/30856815/usgs-seismologist-says-edmond-earthquake-reactivated-fault) that **the dramatic rise in tremors greatly increases the risk of a major catastrophic earthquake** in the state, whose infrastructure is not built for such major events.

Wastewater injection wells have begun to cause problems in other states as well.  Even in Colorado, reputed to have “some of the most comprehensive rules in the nation, if not the world” when it comes to fracking, has had an issue with [wastewater wells triggering earthquakes](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jan/10/fracking-earthquakes-oklahoma-colorado-gas-companies):

> The USGS [linked](http://www.denverpost.com/news/local/ci_22118583/colorado-officials-question-link-of-frackingwaste) a **2011, 5.3-magnitude earthquake on the state’s border with New Mexico to such practices**, and has [warned](http://www.denverpost.com/news/local/ci_27970894/usgs-drafting-new-hazard-maps-as-oil-and-gas-boom-causes-quakes) that **earthquakes are 100 times more likely to occur** now than in 2008 **in areas subject to fracking and wastewater disposal**.

And in California, another state that has experienced earthquakes linked to fracking wastewater injection, [a recent study has definitively linked injection wells to manmade earthquakes](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2016/02/05/3746653/california-link-earthquakes-fracking/):

> According to **the new study**, which **tied a set of 2005 earthquakes near Bakersfield, Calif., to wastewater disposal, injection wells can potentially cause earthquakes several kilometers away**, both **in the short term and months or even years after** the injections take place. The earthquakes studied in the recent report occurred roughly **five miles from the injection sites**. Bakersfield, in Kern County, is roughly 50 miles from the San Andreas Fault.

Another state that has experienced this trend is Arkansas, where residents of the town of Greenbrier convinced state regulators to stop the practice of wastewater injection in 2011 after a series of earthquakes shook that part of the state.  [DeSmog Blog reports](http://www.desmogblog.com/2016/01/26/arkansas-frackquake-victims-commiserate-oklahomans-fracking-wastewater-injection-continues-risking-deadly-earthquakes), however:

> It took a **4.7 magnitude earthquake that shook Greenbrier in 2011** to convince regulators to shut down the area’s wells. “**Since then, the fracking wastewater has been trucked to Oklahoma. I see trucks that are hauling wastewater heading west** on Interstate 40 **for the state line** all the time,” said (*Arkansas resident Dirk*) DeTurck.

So, Oklahoma is actually accepting fracking wastewater from other states and injecting it into their own bedrock.

I wonder why y’all are having all these earthquakes all of a sudden?

# By the way: This is what free trade unfairness looks like

Four days ago, on Wednesday February 10, 2016, a Carrier Corp. factory in Indianapolis (which manufactures heating, ventilation, and air conditioning, HVAC, equipment), and a United Technologies Electronics Controls factory in nearby Huntington (which manufactures microprocessor-based controls for HVAC products) both announced that they were closing down and shipping off to Mexico, [the Indiana Business Journal reports](http://www.ibj.com/articles/57162-carrier-plans-to-lay-off-1400-indy-workers-in-mexico-move). 

The announcement was caught live on a cell phone camera:


Carrier Air Conditioner (part of United Technologies) Moving 1,400 Jobs to Mexico


\<div class="player-unavailable"\>\<h1 class="message"\>An error occurred.\</h1\>\<div class="submessage"\>\<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3ttxGMQOrY" target="_blank"\>Try watching this video on www.youtube.com\</a\>, or enable JavaScript if it is disabled in your browser.\</div\>\</div\>_

UTEC and Carrier Corp. are two subsidiaries of a Hartford, CT Fortune 500 company called United Technologies Corp.  

UTEC and Carrier Corp. are leaving behind 700 jobless workers in Huntington, and 1,400 jobless in Indianapolis.  

The reason for United Technologies Corp.’s decision is not hard to discern.  [The IBJ reports](http://www.ibj.com/articles/57162-carrier-plans-to-lay-off-1400-indy-workers-in-mexico-move):

> The (*Indy*) plant opened in the early 1950s. The average wage for union members there is about $23 an hour, which is almost four times what many manufacturing jobs in Mexico pay.

This Fortune 500 company just had to save a few bucks an hour. 

Or, ya know, if you want to put that into industry-spokesman terms, take the words of Chris Nelson, [as reported by the Indy Star](http://www.indystar.com/story/money/2016/02/10/carrier-move-indy-unit-mexico-eliminate-1400-jobs/80181804/): 

> Relocating our operations to a region where we have existing infrastructure and a strong supplier base will allow us to operate more cost effectively 

United Technologies’ decision came totally out of the blue, according to labor representatives:

> This was not expected at all,” said Chris Jones, president of United Steelworkers Local 1999, which represents 1,300 workers at the Indianapolis plant. “At no time did we think this was a possibility. The plant had been there a long time. It was very profitable, and we had not had a lot of issues.”

The effect on the local economy will be palpable.  [In economist-terms](http://www.indystar.com/story/money/2016/02/10/carrier-move-indy-unit-mexico-eliminate-1400-jobs/80181804/): 

> “The bad news is you lose 1,400 jobs that are midrange manufacturing jobs in terms of wages in Indianapolis,” said (*Michael Hicks, economic expert at Ball State University*). “It’s going to have a ripple effect. The traditional multipliers means those workers will buy fewer things.”

Or to put it in plain language:

> “Because of corporate greed, 1,300 of our members and their families have a hell of a price to pay,” Chris Jones said.

“Free” trade is a misnomer.  The only entities that become more “free” due to free trade policies (including NAFTA, which we have to thank for setting the stage for this mass layoff in Indy) are the wealthy corporations who become “free” to ignore the workers who have made their products for decades and “free” to continue the race to the bottom.

# Flint is ground zero for largest Legionnaire’s disease outbreak in a decade

We knew this already, but just now the national media is really having a field day with it: Emails released from Governor Rick Snyder’s administration in Michigan have conclusively confirmed that state officials close to the Governor knew about a likely connection between a Legionnaire’s disease outbreak in the greater Flint area, and the switch to the Flint River as a drinking water source for the city.  Legionnaire’s disease is a form of bacterial pneumonia that is spread through water vapor, and common transmission vectors include air-conditioning units and vaporizers.

In what Fox2 Detroit, with tardy but voracious aplomb, is calling [“a possible bombshell in the Flint water crisis”](http://www.fox2detroit.com/news/flint-water-crisis/84537332-story), emails acquired through a Freedom of Information Act request by Progress Michigan show that Snyder’s office knew about the connection between Legionnaire’s and the Flint River at least ten months before the Governor revealed it to the public.

[The Guardian](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/feb/04/governor-rick-snyder-urged-to-quit-flint-water-crisis-emails-legionnaires-outbreak?CMP=share_btn_fb) reports:

> **When Snyder disclosed the spike in legionnaires’ cases on 13 January**, he said he had **learned about it just a couple of days earlier**. But emails obtained by the liberal group Progress Michigan through public-records requests **show Snyder’s own office was aware of the outbreak since last March**.

In the same breath:

> At the time, **others in the administration** were **scrambling to respond to suggestions that bacteria in the city’s new water source, the Flint river, could be the culprit**.
> The outbreak was **also well known within state agencies**, according to emails obtained separately by the AP and other news organizations. Together, the emails offer **more evidence that some state officials were dismissive of county health authorities** who raised concerns about the safety of the community’s drinking water.

The incriminating date is March 10, 2015.  This is when the Environmental Health Supervisor of the Genesee County Health Department, Jim Henry, submitted his own Freedom of Information Act request to the City of Flint.  He wanted testing locations, lab results, the boundaries of the city water system, and any locations of dead ends, pooling, and low pressure in the system.

In [his accompanying letter](https://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/297679613?access_key=key-v3iFHmySTmJwGOVbo6sL&allow_share=true&escape=false&view_mode=scroll), Henry writes:

> **The increase of the illnesses closely corresponds with the timeframe of the switch to Flint River water**.  The majority of the cases reside or have an association with the city.  Also, **McLaren Hospital identified and mitigated Legionella in their water system**.  This is rather **glaring information and it needs to be looked into now**, prior to the warmer summer months when Legionella is at its peak and we are potentially faced with a crisis.
> **This situation has been explicitly explained to MDEQ and many of the city’s officials**.  I want to make sure, in writing that there are no misunderstandings regarding this significant and urgent public health issue.  **The trihalomethane issues “pale in comparison” to the potential health risks of Legionella**.

MDEQ didn’t take it seriously, and it wasn’t “looked into now”.  The response from the city was:

> **The DEQ fully recognizes the public health threat** posed to individuals that contract Legionnaires Disease **with the understanding that the disease is not contracted by ingestion of potable water and therefore not regulated under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act**.  Your email below claims that you have explicitly explained the situation to our Department.  However, since contacting our office early last October to indicate a rise in cases, **we have not received any further information regarding your epidemiological investigation into this matter**.
> Further, **conclusions that legionella is coming from the public water system** without the presentation of any substantiating evidence from your epidemiological investigation **appears premature and prejudice** (*sic*) **toward that end**.

MDEQ’s Brad Wurfel (who, by the way, has since resigned) actually seems to be confused here.  Henry’s “epidemiological investigation” was waiting on the release of the same documents that MDEQ refused to give him.

Then [on March 13, 2015, Wurfel sent an email](https://www.scribd.com/fullscreen/297679613?access_key=key-v3iFHmySTmJwGOVbo6sL&allow_share=true&escape=false&view_mode=scroll) to Snyder’s “director of urban initiatives”, Harvey Hollins.  Included in the email was this excerpt:
> …Jim Henry with Genesee County Health is putting up the flare.  **He’s made the leap formally** in his email that the **uptick in cases is directly attributable to the river** as a drinking water source – this beyond irresponsible, given that is **his department that has failed to do the necessary traceback work to provide any conclusive evidence of where the outbreak is sourced**, and it also flies in the face of the very thing a drinking water system is designed to do.

Again, it seems rather strange that MDEQ is impeding the investigations of county health administrators with one hand, and scolding them for not investigating fast enough with the other hand.

### Checking the data

This partisan bickering gets tiresome after too long.  Do you want to see something more important?  How about looking into that question raised by Jim Henry’s email — did the Legionnaire’s outbreak correspond to the switch to the Flint River?  For that, I can only give you the data:

￼![](635890002018809487-dfp-legionnaires-disease-presto.jpg)  
[Photo](http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1f3501e16b52dd5b0ea6483e9b4a57a22efd02c3/c=248-955-2276-2479&r=x408&c=540x405/local/-/media/2016/01/21/DetroitFreePress/DetroitFreePress/635890002018809487-DFP-Legionnaires-disease-PRESTO.jpg) credit: Martha Thierry, Detroit Free Press/Tribune News Service

Some dates to keep in mind — but only two:
1. The City of Flint switched to sourcing water from the Flint River on **April 25th, 2014**.
	2. Flint finally reconnected with DWSD on **October 16, 2015**.

Look at the data.

A month after the city switches to sourcing from the river, cases of Legionnaire’s disease spike to a level they have not reached in at least four years.

They continue to be \>300% higher than they have ever been in the last four years.

At precisely the interval that the city turns off the river water and turns on Lake Huron water from Detroit, cases of Legionnaire’s disease drop down to zero.

This can’t be satisfactorily explained by a seasonal change because November & December 2014 (when river water was flowing) reported far higher cases than November & December 2015 (when the river feed was stopped).

The emails released by Progress Michigan [call](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/documents_show_agencies_knew_o.html) the outbreak “one of the largest we know of in the past decade”, and one close look at the data shows you why health researchers are worried.

We can play the blame game [all we want](http://www.heraldonline.com/news/article58102418.html), but the disease data doesn’t lie.

# Following a lead: Henry County Water Company, Missouri

Famed environmental activist Erin Brockovich posted a public warning on Facebook three days ago (2/3), *warning* consumers that they *would* be told about dangerously high levels of trihalomethanes (THMs) in their water beginning on February 16.

Yes, that’s right.  I, too, was confused about the prediction of a problem that has not yet been revealed to the public.  My guess is that Brockovich has some inside information that we have yet to see.  Here is the first half of the Facebook post:

> Water consumers of Henry County Water Company, Missouri… you’re going to be getting a double dose of toxic trihalomethanes in your drinking water for the next two months [beginning](#) February 16th…
> They will tell you not to worry the fact the water is brown is not a health issue… it’s perfectly safe… LIES.
> The water will be ridiculously over the limit for heavy metals… and far exceeding the maximum contaminant level for TTHMs. They will tell you it “might” cause cancer if you doing (sic) the water for 70 years… while completely ignoring the facts:
> Women with high personal exposure to total trihalomethanes (TTHM) during their first trimester of pregnancy had a miscarriage rate of 15.7%, compared to a miscarriage rate of 9.5% among women with low TTHM exposure (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95% confidence interval 1.1-3.0).
> Maternal exposure to THMs may be associated with fetal growth retardation…

Brockovitch continues with more supporting evidence about the dangers of TTHM-contaminated drinking water, especially for pregnant women.  Read the link above if interested.

But what I am curious about (besides “How does she know?”) is what exactly is the context for all of this, and are there other clues that support Brockovich’s prediction?

[A quick Google search doesn’t reveal much](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=henry+county+water+company).  In fact, the top five hits aren’t even for water authorities in the state of Missouri.  What we are looking for is not the Henry County Water Authority of Georgia (first four hits) and *not* the Henry County Water District of Kentucky (fifth hit).

So first lesson learned: there are a lot of Henry Counties in the United States, and most of them have water companies.

Luckily, my Google-fu is strong, and I pulled several context clues from the comments on Brockovich’s post.  First, is the proximity to Garden City, Missouri, which one commenter specifically noted had terrible water for a long time, with the Missouri DNR telling him not to even drink the water after it has been boiled:

> Commenter: Erin how can I get you the information for our water which is a **neighboring Community Garden City Missouri** we have had multiple do not drink because of issues with the water and **the water department continually tells us it’s okay to drink** but if you called **DNR they say don’t even boiled water because it then atomizes the chemicals that are in the water therefore making it easier to inhale or ingest** these particles. I really don’t know what to do could someone please contact me for some help.

Maybe what we are looking for, then, is the [Henry County Public Water Supply](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Henry+County+Public+Water+Supply/@38.397238,-93.9652618,11.72z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x87c6b6e7e97a462b:0x21a8e33936903fb2), located in Urich, MO, a few miles northwest on State Highway 7 from Clinton, MO, which is the county seat of Henry County, MO, and a few miles southeast of Garden City, MO on Highway 7.  (The link leads to a Google Map; check my work.)

Now that we have an address, finding the website for the water utility is easy.  But here is where things start to get interesting.

Firstly, things are not what they seem.  Despite being called a “Public Water Supply”, Henry County Water Company is owned by a private water company called [Alliance Water Resources](http://www.alliancewater.com/), based out of Columbia, MO.  According to their website, Alliance “completely” manages the water system for Henry County:

> The Henry County Public Water Supply District #3 is a federally funded water district. Its management is vested in a Board of Directors which consists of five members located throughout each of five sub-districts. Alliance provides complete contract management services for the District, including operations and maintenance of the booster pump station, oversight maintenance and repair of the distribution system through outside contractors, billing/collection, management and administration for 1,000 customer connections serving approximately 3,200 people.

In other words, the federal government funds the water district, but Alliance, a private company runs the day-to-day operations…and they are collecting the bill each month.

But their website goes on to say — and this is where things become even less as they seem:

> **In 2012, the District closed their water plant** and connected to Henry County Water Company’s plant **and purchased 100% of its water from Henry County Water Company**.

To clarify: the “Henry County Water Company”, according to Alliance Water Resources, is the local water utility of the city of Clinton, MO.  It was distinct from the Henry County PWSD until 2012, and now the distinction is less clear.  This is most likely what Brockovich is referring to.

[The Henry County Water Company is also operated by Alliance Water Resources](http://www.alliancewater.com/project/henry-county-mo/).  Again according to the Alliance website:

> The Henry County Water Company is a not-for-profit corporation formed by the City of Clinton in 1983 with Alliance’s guidance. Its management is vested in a board of directors, which includes the City Administrator and four citizen members. Alliance provides complete contract management services, including operations and maintenance of the water treatment plant, maintenance and repair of the water distribution system, and billing, management, and administration for 4,600 customer connections serving some 9,300 people. […](#) Alliance Water Resources has furnished the entire management, administrative, operations, and maintenance staff for the water utility since its inception in 1983.

As best as I can decipher, this means that prior to 2012, the Henry County Water Company and the Henry County Public Water Supply District were separate entities both managed by the same private water company.  So when Henry County PWSD decided to purchase water from the Henry County Water Company, that means that Alliance Water Resources was simply consolidating its network of managed water supplies.

Could the consolidation have changed the chemistry of the water in Henry County pipelines in some way?  There’s no way to tell until more information is released.  (And if Brockovich is right, that may be after February 16th.)

But we can look, briefly, at some examples of *other* Alliance-managed water contracts.  Alliance Water Resource currently manages more than 25 water systems in Missouri (plus a few in Iowa), and [in 2011 was pegged for rapid growth by local business journals](http://columbiabusinesstimes.com/2011/04/15/alliance-water-resources-expands-presence-in-missouri/).  So how are their water systems doing?

On December 23 of last year (12/23/2015) the Boonville, MO Daily News reported that levels of trihalomethanes were higher than the federally allowed limit in Boonville residents’ drinking water:

> **Alliance Water Resources wanted to reassure the public** that the Boonville Municipal Water is safe to drink. **This comes after a letter was sent out, which is required by law, that stated there were disinfection byproducts that were higher than the water standards** set by the Department of Natural Resources.
> After samples were taken **in August, the byproduct known as Trihalomethane (TTHM) had higher levels than usual…**

That sounds familiar, doesn’t it?  That letter that the Boonville Daily News said is “required by law” [is actually an EPA form letter](http://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2014-04/documents/pn_tthm_haa5_mcl.pdf), a fill-in-the-blanks notice that is required by federal law to be released to the public.  The citizens of Flint got one on January 2, 2015.

That’s not all.  Clinton, Utah’s water system is also managed by Alliance Water Resources.  (Don’t get confused: this is Clinton, UT not Clinton, MO.)  [In August 2014, residents there were informed that they had elevated levels of coliform bacteria](http://www.uswaternews.com/contamination-in-clintons-water-supply/) (presented here as e. coli) in their drinking water:

> Residents of Clinton have been warned about the possible **contamination of their tap water with E. coli**.
> … **The city’s water resources are managed by Alliance Water Resources** which **changed to well water three years ago** because it was easier to guarantee safety for the users than when the water is sourced from open grounds such as lakes or rivers.

It was determined that the cause of the contamination was [a “contractor error” that connected irrigation water to culinary water lines](http://www.standard.net/Government/2014/08/06/dirty-water).  That’s not a good thing, no matter how you slice it.  But even worse is the fact that it happened again the following year.  In early June 2015, [another coliform bacteria contamination](http://www.standard.net/Local/2015/06/08/Clinton-Syracuse-both-remain-on-water-boil-advisory) was found in the Clinton water system:

> A drinking water boil advisory remains in place for both Syracuse and Clinton cities due to separate discoveries of E. coli and coliform contamination being found in each of the cities’s culinary water system.

During this entire time frame, Alliance Water Resources was managing the Clinton water supply.

Alliance Water Resources also has a habit of acquiring the management rights to public water utilities that have been cited for various wrongdoings.  For example, rural Kearney, MO had chlorine disinfectant residuals that were “not properly reported” from 2009 to 2015.  If you’re wondering what that means, apparently [in this case](http://www.kearneycourier.com/community_living/article_427d1fe5-0cc7-5102-92d9-be037caeb0e6.html), it means the water operator was:

> …writing numbers down for the free and chlorine residuals on the bacteriological sampling cards based on his years of experience, rather than actually testing with the pocket colorimeter.

That’s pretty bad, and it got him fired.  Alliance, however, was quick to parlay their experience into a contract “for operations and management” of the Kearney water system, and as of today they still manage the system.

### What we do know

Honestly, I have no idea why Erin Brockovich is so certain that something bad is going to go down with the Henry County Water Company on February 16th.  But here is what I know:

Henry County Water Company is a public water infrastructure owned and operated by a private water company, Alliance Water Resources.

Alliance often acquires contracts by aggressively targeting cities and municipalities that have problems complying with federal drinking water regulations.

Alliance-managed water systems, most notably in Boonville, MO, and Clinton, UT, have experienced water crises in the past two years that bear a striking resemblance to the crises that were precursors to the Flint tragedy — namely, coliform bacteria and trihalomethanes (“disinfection byproducts”).

Residents say that cities near the Henry County Water Company, like Garden City, MO, have terrible water quality that shows many similarities, on the surface, to the drinking water coming from the Flint River.

Keep your eye on Clinton, MO — let’s see if Brockovich is right.

# Jackson, Mississippi also has an unreported lead problem

Add another city to the list.

Flint, MI.  Sebring, OH.  Warren, OH.

And now Jackson, MS.  Just last Friday, January 29th, Jackson residents learned that six months ago their drinking water contained dangerous levels of lead.  The Jackson Clarion-Ledger reports:

> Jackson residents learned Friday that the water in some homes in the area has tested positive for lead above the recommended level. Those results came from samples gathered and tested six months ago.

When they first announced the fact, city officials did not release any numbers, although we do know that to be considered a dangerously elevated level of lead, the lead content of the water would have to exceed 15 parts per billion (ppb).

The really outstanding fact from the initial Clarion-Ledger report is the paragraph that draws explicit parallels between Jackson and Flint:

> **Before August 2014, Jackson’s Maddox Road Well system served much of south Jackson** along the Mississippi 18 corridor. At that time, **the city took the well system offline** and the **residents’ service was switched to surface water**.

At this point, the similarities to Flint, MI should practically scream out at us.  Like Jackson, Flint had once been on a stable and safe source of water: Lake Huron in Flint’s case, a well system in Jackson’s.  Like Jackson, Flint had taken itself off of this stable and secure system and put itself on river water.  The result, in both cases: lead in the drinking water; in both cases, probably from corroded pipes.

But just how much lead are we talking about here?

On February 4th, the Clarion-Ledger followed up its original story:

> Newly released **data show that the elevated lead levels** detected in the water of Jackson and Byram residences in June was **as high as 128 parts per billion**, or more than eight times the federal action level.

To compare to Flint, the first time Leeanne Walters had her house tested, her lead levels were at 104 ppb.

It seems that the lead levels in most of the houses in Jackson have since gone down — then again, the levels in Flint seemed to do so too, but according only to official statistics.

The next question we must ask — the one that EPA regulations manager Miguel del Toral and Virginia Tech water expert Marc Edwards both agreed was the first question one should ask — is, did the City of Jackson have corrosion control measures in place before the lead was found in the water?

Unfortunately, no one asked this specific question at any press conference.  But from their own press release, the City of Jackson seems less-than-confident in the amount of corrosion control they currently have.  As reprinted in the Clarion-Ledger:

> “**Next steps** will include identifying funding **to upgrade corrosion control measures** and **increased monitoring in the distribution system**,” a Jackson news release states.

Of course, we can’t be sure of the answer to this question — Did the City of Jackson have corrosion control measures in place *before* drinking water from the city tested positive for lead? — until someone asks it.  But someone should.

Someone really should.

# Prisoners and undocumented in Flint: “The least among you, suffer even more”

### Prisoners
[An exclusive report from Democracy Now!](http://www.democracynow.org/2016/2/4/exclusive_report_how_long_did_flints) is showing that inmates in Flint’s prisons were forced to drink, bathe in, and eat food prepared with tap water, for almost the entire span of time that Flint’s water system was taking in corrosive water from the Flint River and pumping it through decrepit pipes that leached lead into the water coming from the taps.

Apparently, inmates in Genesee County were still drinking tap water before newly elected Flint Mayor Karen Weaver declared a public health emergency in October 2015.  After the announcement, inmates briefly were given access to safe bottled water.  But:

> Five days later, the jail switched back to the city supply after the sheriff said a water quality test showed the water was safe. That means the inmates were forced to drink, bathe in and eat food cooked in the city’s contaminated water. Finally, last Friday (1/29), the jail again switched to using bottled water.”

Jody Cramer, a former inmate at Genesee County jail who was serving a two-month sentence, spoke to Amy Goodman and Nermeen Shaikh at Democracy Now! about the crisis.  During his incarceration, he worked as a trustee in the kitchen, distributing food and water to other inmates. According to Goodman’s synopsis:

> (*Cramer*) says once water distribution began **this past Friday, he was instructed to distribute two 12-ounce bottles of water twice a day** to prisoners—or a **total of 48 ounces per day**. That’s **less than half the amount of water the Institute for Medicine recommends adult men drink daily**. Cramer also says **there are a number of pregnant women in the jail and that they, too, were drinking the tap water** up until last Friday’s switch.

Cramer also says there was a clear distinction between what was judged as “safe enough” for inmates, and the standards for ordinary citizens:

> **JODY CRAMER**: In jail, **we were drinking from the taps**. Our food was being made from the taps. Prior to this, **they had already started handing out bottles of water** when this first broke **in October**. And **then they stopped**, saying that their water was good. **Many inmates made complaints due to the fact that the deputies would not drink from the faucets—they all carried bottled water.**

And when inmates were finally afforded the same safe water as their fellow citizens outside, they were stiffed.  As already stated, the recommended amount of water for an adult male is 100 oz. per day; for an adult female, 73 oz. per day.  Inmates in Flint were being given:

> **CRAMER**: I’d get **four bottles of water a day**. I have **two bottles at lunchtime, two bottles at dinnertime, per inmate**. Yeah, **I have to not only drink this water**, but **I have to brush my teeth. I drink coffee.** We’ve been told that there’s **nothing wrong with washing your body or hands** with this water out the tap, that it’s just consuming it. That’s what they’ve told.

In fact, it was not safe to wash you hands or body with the water from the tap.  [Flint residents even brought water samples and clumps of their own fallen-out hair to DC yesterday](http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/flint-residents-bring-clumps-of-hair-and-brown-water-to-washington/ar-BBp5eeG) for Congressional hearings.  Showering in Flint tap water, especially when that water had high trihalomethane counts, was not safe.

Pregnant women, who are especially at risk from lead, THM, and other water-borne contaminants in the Genesee County jail were not being given access to clean water either.

> **CRAMER**: There is pregnant women inside the Genesee County Jail, several pregnant women inside Genesee County Jail. … As far as I know, **they get the same amount of water as anybody else**.

Criminal injustices also happened outside in the civilian world.  Some deputies, Cramer reports, would serve warrants in the guise of passing out water filtration systems to residents:

> **CRAMER**: **A lot of the deputies were passing out water filtration systems** or—in the city. If you had warrants—**they did a warrant sweep while they did that, so they tricked you**. If you answered your door, and they would say, **“Hey, how are you doing, Mr. Cramer?” If I responded, then I just confirmed that I’m me.** “Well, here’s your water filtration system. **By the way, you have a warrant for your arrest**.” People were saying that’s how they got arrested.

### Undocumented

While inmates were forced to drink tap water through the entirety of 2015, after federal law, independent university researchers, and the EPA had all admitted that the water was not safe — in fact, it was highly dangerous — other disadvantaged populations were struggling in their own way to keep up with the shifting tapestry of facts and denials from on high.

As uncertainty mounted among Flint residents regarding the quality of their water in 2014 and 2015, some segments of the population were left totally out of the discussion.  Advocates for undocumented workers in Flint, such as San Juana Olivares-Macias, who is affiliated with the Genesee County Hispanic-Latino Collaborative and the Hispanic Technology and Community Center in Flint and who spoke at a meeting of the Council of Graduates Students at MSU on January 27, 2015, reports that some undocumented people in Flint were “**not receiving water because they are undocumented**” and “**not getting lead testing**” just because “**they don’t have photo IDs**“.  Although this problem has thankfully been rectified, the delay in getting water and lead testing to these people means that they were drinking possibly dangerous water, and ignorant of their lead poisoning status, far longer than others who are better-connected or more well-off.

A much more severe problem among the undocumented population, however, is a lack of information.  Olivares-Macias reported on January 27th that “**About the lead in the water…some of them didn’t even know.  I know some of them didn’t know until Sunday**”.  (“Sunday” would mean January 24, so 18 days after a spectacularly overdue state of emergency was declared by the Governor.)  Olivares-Macias even says that one pregnant woman had no idea that anything at all was wrong with the water:

> One woman, who never knew about the lead issue, drank the water all through her pregnancy.

### Pregnant women

Of course, lead poisoning is bad no matter who it happens to, but in both vignettes above we have consistently mentioned one category of people: pregnant women.  In both the Genesee County Jail, and in undocumented communities, pregnant women were drinking water contaminated with carcinogens (THMs) and lead.

Some of the more skeptical might suggest that talking about pregnant women is a way to play on our heartstrings, and not proof of anything in particular.  Not so.

One of the most recent studies on the subject of lead poisoning in pregnancy is [this study from 2014 by a group of Chinese researchers](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24704588) from Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou.  They studied pregnant mothers who had high BLLs (blood lead levels) during pregnancy, and the neurobehavior of their newborns.  They concluded:

> CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrates that **fetal lead exposure as low as 5μg/dL has an adverse effect on neurodevelopment, most expressed during the first trimester**, and best arrested by measuring maternal BLLs. **The collective evidence indicates that screening and intervention after the first trimester may be too late** to prevent the fetal neurotoxic effects.

In plain language, this means that the developing brains of fetuses in the womb will be irreversibly injured if exposed to lead that, at 5 ug/dL, doesn’t even qualify as “abnormally elevated” by EPA standards.  (EPA standards set 5 ug/dL as the maximum blood lead level that is “acceptable”, or not mandating intervention.)

Again, in plain language, this means that the children of pregnant women who drank tap water sourced from the Flint River from April 2014-October 2015 will live an entire lifespan operating at a fraction of their mental potential.

Once more in plain language, this means that once again, we as a society have chosen to subject “the least among you” — Flint’s undocumented and prisoners in this case — to the most suffering.  Not only that, but we have ensured that their children will suffer, too, for the rest of their lives.

In plain language, this is wrong.

# Telesur: Flint is part of a greater struggle for water rights

Kari Lyderson at TelesurTV.net has a great piece on the Flint water crisis that everyone should read.  She very persuasively argues that Flint is but one puzzle piece in a wider struggle over water rights in the state of Michigan.  Here’s an especially cogent excerpt:

*Lyderson*:

> …**residents and watchdogs are still trying to figure out the full story** behind the maneuvers, and **many think that privatizing Flint’s water system was the ultimate goal**.
> The **multi-national French water company Veolia was hired by the emergency manager** and paid $900 an hour to **analyze Flint’s water system** last year, for a total of almost $40,000. **Global Exchange describes Veolia as the “largest water privatization business in the world.”**  
> **In Detroit, Veolia was also hired** to evaluate the water system, at the same time **a new regional water authority** was created that **many saw as priming the pump for privatization.**

Veolia Water North America has, incidentally, had ample opportunity to prove that they can successfully manage a city-wide water treatment and distribution system — but their record is not good.  Their highest-profile failure was the attempt to manage Indianapolis, IN’s municipal water system, but that venture failed after the company was [put under investigation for “water quality concerns”](http://www.wthr.com/story/3927046/veolia-water-indianapolis-under-investigation) and then [booted from their contract](http://www.ibj.com/articles/23102-veolia-losing-water-contract-will-get-29m-termination-fee).

Lyderson writes:

> **More than 30,000 Detroit residents have had their water shut off** since 2013, when the **water authority began aggressively pursuing people** behind on their bills and turned over enforcement to a private agency.
> To rub salt in the wound, **some residents were charged exorbitant bills for water that leaked** or poured out of damaged pipes, often ruptured by copper theft, age, or other **factors beyond the residents’ control**. And since **water debts are added to property tax bills**, the water crisis has forced families to lose their homes to foreclosure, gutted the value of their homes, and put them at risk of having their children removed by state authorities.
> **Many wonder whether water infrastructure in Flint, Detroit and other cities has been allowed to degrade intentionally or tacitly in order to open the way for a private operator to take over. Similar scenarios** have played out in **other parts of the world**; for example **in El Salvador** a decade ago, and famously with the **“water war” in Cochabamba, Bolivia**, in 2000.

[In El Salvador](http://upsidedownworld.org/main/el-salvador-archives-74/445-not-for-sale-el-salvadors-movement-against-water-privatization), an Inter-American Development Bank loan that was accepted by the government forced the country to privatize its water system, but poor service and brown water lead people to impassioned protest, eventually leading to a reclamation of public utilities by a state-administered, unionized water system.  [In Cochabamba, a city in central Bolivia](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/04/08/leasing-the-rain), a “private, foreign-led consortium” of water privateers, lead by the US corporation Bechtel, tried to privatize the city’s water, even installing meters on community-owned wells, before massive protests drove them out of the country.

Lyderson again:

> “It’s **all about money, it’s about greed, it’s a perfect example of environmental racism**,” in Flint and Detroit, said Peggy Case, president of the group Michigan Citizens for Water Conservation (MCWC). “This would not be happening in Traverse City where I live, it would not be happening in Bloomfield Hills or Ann Arbor.”

Dr. Robert Bullard of Texas Southern University has a [similar take on the situation](http://rockrivertimes.com/2016/01/22/flints-water-crisis-is-a-blatant-example-of-environmental-injustice/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter):

> Unequal protection is a reality. **The right to clean air, clean water and safe places for kids to play is something that affluent communities take for granted**. But **many low-income and minority communities don’t get parks**, or **street lights**, or **housing code enforcement**, or **safe drinking water**. The **cumulative environmental stresses** in these neighborhoods **create a toxic stew**. And **then government agencies don’t respond** when people complain. **The government’s nonresponse to Flint’s water crisis is on the scale of the federal nonresponse to Hurricane Katrina.**

Since Dr. Bullard mentions it, there is extensive evidence that [Hurricane Katrina was used as an excuse to push through otherwise-unpopular privatization schemes](http://www.democracynow.org/2015/8/28/shock_doctrine_a_look_at_the).  Flint needs to be smart enough not to fall for this trick in the days & months to come.

# Water privatization across the country; water poisoning in Indian country

You know about Flint.  You’ve heard about Sebring, OH.

In both places, basically the same thing happened: lax controls, oversight, and regulation allowed corrosive river water to leach lead from old pipes into the drinking water.

Flint is finally being treated like the catastrophe that it is, more than a year after it should have been.  That is good, because nowhere else in the country have scientifically confirmed levels of lead in the drinking water been so high that [tap water is more dangerous than toxic waste.](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/08/hazardous-waste-levels-of-lead-found-in-a-flint-households-water/)

However, local and national press is finally picking up on another problem that is widespread and dangerous, and needs attention — namely, the shoddy condition of America’s water infrastructure.

Remember, the water system in Flint is antiquated and poorly maintained, to the point where many service lines are made of pure lead, and to the point that the City is unsure where all the valves and switches are and how they work — to the point where during 2015 at least one valve was broken while the city was mapping and testing the system’s switches and valves.  In early summer 2015, the EPA water expert Miguel del Toral personally stopped in Flint near Leeanne Walters’ house and [confirmed that the water service line connecting to her house was lead](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/09/commentary-mdeq-mistakes-deception-flint-water-crisis/).

> After Walters told Del Toral about the high lead results, **he drove back to Flint**, just in time to **observe the City replacing the service line** to Walters’ home. **He personally collected a sample of the pipe and verified it to be pure lead**.

In June 2015, first the city was [testing the valves](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/06/city_warns_of_possible_low_pre.html) near Pierson Road, and warning residents of “potential” water discoloration:

> The city is warning of the **potential for discolored water and low pressure** in parts of Flint where crews are testing water main valves.
> (*The city stated:*) “…**Service should return to normal once work is completed**.”

But then, the next day, the city was informing residents that the valve they were testing had broken, stirring up even more sediment (which contextual evidence suggests was carrying at least some lead particulates):

> **A broken valve** could knock out pressure and discolor water in the area of Pierson Road and I-475, the city says.
> … The valve **break came as crews were [testing the water distribution system](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/06/city_warns_of_possible_low_pre.html)** in the area of Oceola Avenue and I-475, according to the city.
> Sediment in the water line may also discolor water in the area, but it is **still safe to use, according to the city**.

At the very least, these two events clue us in to the fact that a much bigger problem is at the root of this crisis: the decay of Flint’s water infrastructure.

This is a bigger issue, not least because it will take tremendous amounts of money and time.  [An internal Snyder email puts the cost at $60 million and 15 years, but experts disagree](http://www.wired.com/2016/01/heres-how-hard-it-will-be-to-unpoison-flints-water/):

> Harold Harrington, **business manager of Flint’s plumber’s union, the United Association (*of Plumbers and Pipefitters*) Local 370** … says **digging up and replacing a forty foot length of lead pipe costs around $3,000**. This **does not take into account externalities** like repaving streets and sidewalks, fixing any damage done to the home, and resodding lawns. **Multiply $3,000 by 20,000 pipes and you get $60 million dollars**—which **suggests that the figure quoted in Michigan governor Snyder’s email is probably a lowball**.

But Harrington also disagrees that the process will take as long as Snyder is estimating:

> Harrington estimates that he could reasonably call in about 20 such teams to work full time until the job is done. Assuming the rate is forty pipes a day, roughly 249 days a year (nights and weekends, y’all), the Flint plumber’s militia could bang the job out in just over two years.

Yes, you heard that correctly: what we have before this Governor is the choice to do something slowly and cheaply or quickly and more expensively.  The cost of doing something slowly is the deteriorating health of the people of Flint.  Will that cost finally outweigh financial penny-pinching in the mind of our governor?  It has to, for the sake of the poisoned children in Flint.  Thankfully, [Michigan may be ordered by a federal court to replace Flint’s water infrastructure](http://gizmodo.com/flint-may-be-ordered-by-a-federal-court-to-replace-its-1755461018?), so perhaps the threat of jail will lubricate the process for our esteemed Governor.

Decaying water infrastructure is a big deal for Flint.  And it is a big deal for Sebring, OH, whose water system one can only assume will need similar attention.

But the roots of the problem go deeper and wider still.

Flint is not the only city in Michigan with aging, leaded water pipes.  Flint and Sebring are not the only cities in the Midwest with decrepit water infrastructure.  As the Huffington Post reports, [many cities in the country have the same problems](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lead-pipes-everywhere_us_56a8e916e4b0f71799288f54).  In fact:

> **Roughly 10 million American homes and buildings receive water from service lines that are at least partially lead**, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Service lines are the pipes connecting water mains to people’s houses. **Lead ones are mostly found in the Midwest and Northeast**.
> … Even replacing the lines can be trouble, however, as **the law only requires replacing the lines on public property** — replacing the portion of a lead service line on private property is up to the owner — and **it turns out that replacing just the public portion of a lead service line can cause lead levels to spike in a homeowner’s water**. That’s because the work involved in **replacing just part of a lead service line can jostle free lead** in the the remaining part of the pipe.
> (The **Safe Drinking Water Act originally called for utilities to replace the entirety of a lead service line**, but [lobbying and a lawsuit](http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/08/08/13179335-how-an-epa-project-backfired-endangering-drinking-water-with-lead) by **the American Water Works Association watered down the rule**.)

Milwaukee, in fact, has already embarked on [a $511 million project to replace all its lead service lines](http://www.jsonline.com/news/milwaukee/milwaukee-facing-daunting-costs-with-lead-water-pipes-b99658687z1-366754751.html), trying to forestall problems (with the city’s 70,000 lead lateral pipes) before they arise, as they did in Flint and Sebring.

In Flint, lead leached from decaying pipes [caused lead poisoning in infants](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/09/pediatric-lead-exposure-presentation-from-hurley-medical-center-doctors-concerning-flint-mi/); a horrible tragedy.  But lead poisoning — as barbaric and preventable as it sounds — is actually [widespread in the United States](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/21/10811004/lead-poisoning-cities-us/in/10563335).  In the most affected areas, the percentage of children with lead poisoning was measured between 10.3% (Dubois County, IN) and 58.3% (!!! Houston County, AL).  This doesn’t mean that Flint’s lead poisoning is insignificant, on the contrary, it just means that Flint’s poisoned water is one symptom of a much larger contamination.

Contamination of water from industrial sources and bad management is a quintessential 21st century problem caused by a 20th century mindset.  Even without looking at the rest of the country, there is a misplacement of priorities within the state of Michigan.  Too often 20th century priorities like petroleum, profit, and personal privilege overshadow 21st century needs such as clean water, fresh air, education and health.  [Telesur reports that the results are clear to the people of Flint](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/Flint-is-the-Latest-Front-in-Michigans-Water-Wars-20160130-0012.html):

> “**It’s profit before people**,” said Mays, who moved to Flint in 2002. “**They put more effort into hiding it**, calling us liars and trying to shut us up and cover it up **rather than fix it**.”

The problem is long-standing, Mays insists, and many Flint residents agree.

> …a **web of “incestuous connections” between public officials and corporations** seek to **capitalize on public resources**, water chief among them.

Ground zero for the privileged and powerful to capitalize on the public resource of water is [the water distribution systems themselves](http://www.telesurtv.net/english/opinion/Flint-is-the-Latest-Front-in-Michigans-Water-Wars-20160130-0012.html):

> The move (*to Flint River from DWSD*) was initially widely **described as a cost-saving measure**. However, **recently-revealed emails** between government officials **call that motivation into question**, as it appears the **Detroit authority offered a deal that would have saved Flint money **in the long run. Flint was also scheduled to be moved to clean Lake Huron water by this year thanks to a pipeline being built.
> … So **residents and watchdogs are still trying to figure out the full story** behind the maneuvers, and **many think that privatizing Flint’s water system was the ultimate goal**. The **multi-national French water company Veolia was hired by the emergency manager and paid $900 an hour** to analyze Flint’s water system last year, for a [total of almost $40,000](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/02/flint_water_consultant_team_ch.html). [Global Exchange describes Veolia](http://www.globalexchange.org/economicactivism/veolia/otheroffenses) as **the “largest water privatization business in the world.”** In **Detroit, Veolia was also hired** to evaluate the water system, **at the same time a new regional water authority was created** that many saw as **priming the pump for privatization**.

And Telesur is quick to make a connection between Flint and water privatization efforts in Latin America, because they are just so darn similar:

> Many **wonder whether water infrastructure in Flint, Detroit and other cities has been allowed to degrade intentionally** or tacitly in order **to open the way for a private operator to take over. Similar scenarios have played out** [in other parts of the world](http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2002/04/08/leasing-the-rain); for example in [El Salvador a decade ago](http://upsidedownworld.org/main/el-salvador-archives-74/445-not-for-sale-el-salvadors-movement-against-water-privatization), and famously with the [“water war” in Cochabamba, Bolivia](https://nacla.org/blog/2013/6/5/water-wars-water-scarcity-bolivia%E2%80%99s-cautionary-tale), in 2000.

Follow some of these links.  They are informative.

But if the connection to Latin America is cogent and clear, so are some connections closer to home.

For example, on the topic of heavy metal contamination, Navajo country in eastern Arizona is facing a water contamination crisis that has been described as “horrific” even when compared to the disaster in Flint.

> In the **western U.S., water contamination has been a way of life for many tribes**. As Brenda Norrell, a news reporter in Indian country, describes, **the situation in Navajo nation is “more horrific than in Flint, Michigan.”**

The cause of the contamination in Sanders, Arizona, where almost three quarters of the population is of Native descent, is one that we currently find inconvenient to talk about: mining uranium for nuclear weapons and power.

> **Since the 1950s, their water has been poisoned by uranium mining** to fuel the nuclear industry and the making of atomic bombs for the U.S. military. **Coal mining and coal-fired power plants have added to the mix**. The **latest assault on Navajo water was carried out by the massive toxic spills into the Animas and San Juan rivers** when the EPA recklessly **attempted to address the abandoned Gold King mine**.

The Gold King mine disaster occurred at a shuttered gold mine in Silverton, Colorado.  EPA personnel and contractors hired by EPA (Environmental Restoration, LLC out of Fenton, Missouri) were trying to drain water from an underground tailing pond containing water polluted with cadmium, lead, arsenic, and other contaminants.  According to [the Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_Gold_King_Mine_waste_water_spill):

> **Workers accidentally destroyed the dam holding back the pond, spilling three million US gallons (11 ML) of [mine waste water](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_mine_drainage) and [tailings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tailings)**, including heavy metals such as [cadmium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadmium) and [lead](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead), and other toxic elements, such as [arsenic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arsenic), **into Cement Creek, a tributary of the [Animas River](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animas_River) in Colorado**. The **EPA was criticized for not warning Colorado and New Mexico until the day after** the waste water spilled.

The repeated contamination of Native drinking water sources and surrounding ancestral lands has many Native activists speaking out — although, Native voices have been speaking out for centuries and white America has insisted on pretending we don’t hear:

> “In 2015 **the Gold King Mine spill was a wake-up call** to address dangers of abandoned mines, **but there are currently more than 15,000 toxic uranium mines that remain abandoned throughout the US**,” said **Charmaine White Face from** the South Dakota based organization **Defenders of the Black Hills**. “For more than 50 years, many of **these hazardous sites have been contaminating the land, air, water, and national monuments** such as Mt. Rushmore and the Grand Canyon. **Each one of these** thousands of **abandoned uranium mines is a potential Gold King mine disaster** with the **greater added threat of radioactive pollution. For the sake of our health, air, land, and water, we can’t let that happen.”**

Brenda Norrell, a local journalist from the area, reports that “there is no comprehensive law requiring cleanup of abandoned uranium mines”, meaning that what happens is the mining corporations, with government acquiescence, “walk away from them after exploiting their resources.”  Native communities continue to get the short end of the stick because “75 percent of uranium mines are on federal and Tribal lands”.

Water tests done in the community of Sanders in July 2015 revealed that the levels of uranium in drinking water exceeded the federally established maximum contaminant level.  Water in Sanders contains 37 ppb; the maximum allowed is 30 ppb. In compensation, the Arizona Windsong Company is providing clean water to the community, but not to the local primary school, the Sanders Unified School District.  As of October 14th, the only assistance the school district has received was two pallets of donated bottled water.  [Interim Superintendent of the Sanders Unified School District, Dan Hute weighed in](https://www.popularresistance.org/school-water-poisoned-with-uranium-wheres-the-help/):

> “I have a lot of people calling with what the district has to do, but **my question is what are the state agency going to do for us?**” Hute said. “**We received the water pallets** and that was a godsend, but **bottom line is that’s the only assistance the school has received. Where’s FEMA, where’s any emergency response team, where’s state aid coming from to bring water trucks up here?”**

To be fair, Flint was waiting for some of those water trucks as well.  And in both that case, and with regard to the crisis in the Navajo nation, it is an atrocity that more help has not been offered to those who are suffering.

The difference, however, is that Flint is now getting much more assistance, mostly because people are paying attention to the problem.  They need to pay attention to the problems in Sanders, Arizona, as well — and more importantly, to the [wider problem of water contamination from uranium mines](https://www.popularresistance.org/school-water-poisoned-with-uranium-wheres-the-help/) and water contamination in general:

> Note: **People who believe that nuclear energy is clean often fail to look at the entire uranium chain from excavation to waste storage**.  In the United States, there are **more than 10,000 abandoned uranium mines** which continue to **contaminate the land, water and air**. … **There is no safe dose of radiation**, so this contamination is **likely contributing to cancer and other diseases**. This is a **hidden health emergency** that is **not being addressed**.

Thankfully, Native communities at greatest risk of uranium poisoning are speaking up, gathering together, and taking a stand.  Just a few days ago, activists from [Clean Up The Mines](http://www.cleanupthemines.org/), [Defenders of the Black Hills](https://www.popularresistance.org/15000-abandoned-uranium-mines-protested-at-dc-epa-headquarters/www.defendblackhills.org), [Diné No Nukes](https://www.popularresistance.org/15000-abandoned-uranium-mines-protested-at-dc-epa-headquarters/www.dinenonukes.org), [Laguna and Acoma Coalition for a Safe Environment & Multicultural Alliance for a Safe Environment](http://masecoalition.org/), and Indigenous World Alliance assembled in Washington DC to protest and meet with federal officials.

[They have specific and concrete grievances](https://www.popularresistance.org/15000-abandoned-uranium-mines-protested-at-dc-epa-headquarters/).  Petuuche Gilbert of the Laguna Acoma Coalition for a Safe Environment & President of the Indigenous World Association, points out:

> “The U.S is **discriminating against Indigenous peoples when it permits mining** on these lands. **Specifically, the U.S. is violating: Executive Order 13007**, Executive **13175**, the **American Indian Religious Freedom Act**, the **Religious Freedom Restoration Act**, as well as the **United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples**.”

Tommy Rock, a grad student and co-author of a study uncovering the dangerously high levels of uranium in the Sanders water system, spoke up in DC as well:

> “The **regulatory agencies are responding by** sending the Army National Guard to **provide bottle water for the community of Flint**. However, **the small community of Sanders** which is also **predominantly an Indigenous community** that is off the reservation **are not receiving the same response from the state regulatory agency or the state legislatures and the media**,”
> … “The **same can be said about two Lakota reservations**. They are **Pine Ridge** and **Rock Creek, Standing Rock** Reservation that have **not received any assistance** from regulatory agencies. This **exemplifies the inconsistency** among the US EPA regions **about responding to Indigenous communities compared to non-Indigenous populations which are facing the same issue regarding access to safe drinking water**.”
> … “**Another issue** around water **is the mining industry contaminating the rivers. They are disregarding the Clean Water Act because the act does not address radionuclides**. This **needs to be amended** so the policy can **enforce that companies be accountable for their degradation to the watershed areas**. This can also be **beneficial to US EPA because they do not have the funds to clean every contaminated river** by the mining industry and other commercial industry,”

Charmaine White Face from Defenders of the Black Hills also spoke convincingly about the need for regulatory action to alleviate the ongoing crisis:

> “This is **an invisible national crisis**. **Millions of people** in the United States are **being exposed as Nuclear Radiation Victims** on a daily basis.” said Mrs. White Face. “**Exposure** to radioactive pollution **has been linked to cancer, genetic defects, Navajo Neuropathy, and increases in mortality**. We are protesting the EPA today because **we believe that as more Americans become aware of this homegrown radioactive pollution, then something can be done to protect all peoples and the environment**. In the meetings we had in DC, not only were AUMs (*abandoned uranium mines*) discussed, but we **also talked about radioactive pollution from coal dust, coal smoke, and in water**.
> **These show a need for amendments to the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act**.”
> *Clarification in italics is from me*

To sum up: Flint and Sebring, OH, have had trouble with their water because their water infrastructure is decaying and poorly managed.  And they are not the only city in the Midwest with lead-in-water problems or drinking water problems in general.  All of these problems lead back to infrastructure, regulation, and enforcement — specifically, the lack thereof.  Many Flint residents, watchdog organizations, and onlookers see the actions of Flint and State of Michigan employees as purposely letting public systems fall into disrepair so that they can be privatized, a pattern that has been widely observed in Latin America in recent decades.

However, the problem of water cycle contamination goes deeper and wider than decaying pipelines and infrastructure standards in major cities.  The majority-Indigenous community of Sanders, AZ, has been the victim of a unilateral attack on the safety of their natural water resources by the profit-and-extraction-driven enterprise of uranium mining in the upstream areas of the Animas and San Juan rivers.  Abandoned uranium mines contaminate water sources with not just heavy metals like cadmium and lead, but with radioactive material.  Just like with lead, no exposure to radiation is safe.

The difference between Flint and Sanders, AZ is twofold: Firstly, Native populations are still subject to racism and disinterest from white America.  Says activist Leona Morgan from Dine No Nukes:

> **With adherence to out-dated, racist policies promoting colonialism, such as the 1872 mining law, Indigenous peoples across the country will continue to be oppressed**, and we will **continue to demand that our land be returned and restored to its original condition**, to that of before the colonization by the United States.

A clear difference between Flint and Sanders is that white America has long ago decided that the problems of Native America are not theirs to care about.  This racist and inhuman position is part of the reason why children in Sanders, AZ, are being poisoned with radioactive heavy metals.

Secondly, the truth of Sanders, Pine Ridge, Rock Creek Standing Rock, and other communities is that they challenge a prominent myth in American environmental circles: the “promised land” of cheap, clean, nuclear power.  The fact of the matter is that when you consider the entire supply chain of nuclear energy, including how we mine the fuel and how we dispose of the ashes, it becomes very clearly the dirtiest form of energy, one producing byproducts that, out of all other energy sources, are the most dangerous to human life on the planet.

The truth that the case of Sanders inconveniently reveals to us is that a 21st century environmental movement has to take as its central mission *clean water*, *clean air*, and *clean soil*.  The pursuit of “new forms” of clean *energy* is a farce.  We know how to produce clean energy (and some European countries are already doing it): wind and solar power.  No energy source that involves combustion is clean.

# Another town in eastern Ohio has lead-poisoned water

I’ll get right to it, because this was just posted this afternoon.  The city of Warren held a press conference this afternoon because city officials [announced that some houses in Warren had tested positive for elevated levels of lead last summer](http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/02/high_lead_levels_found_in_warr.html):

> A press conference is scheduled for this afternoon after **two homes** on Perkinswood Boulevard **tested for high amounts of lead in the water last summer, but the entire city was not notified**, [WKBN-TV in Youngstown reported](http://wkbn.com/2016/02/02/warren-officials-to-address-city-water-concerns/). **One of those homes had a reading of 64 parts per billion**, which is about three times higher than the levels in Sebring last month, [which prompted a health alert to be issued](http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/01/excess_amount_of_lead_found_in.html) and schools to be closed.

Things don’t look good in Warren as far as the government reaction, either.  In fact, we have verbal confirmation that the city was not and still is not using corrosion control [from the city’s Utilities Director, Franco Lucarelli](http://wkbn.com/2016/02/02/warren-officials-to-address-city-water-concerns/):

> “The aggregate score was 6.5. If I remember correctly, **by having that aggregate score that low, we did not have to enter into corrosion control**,” Lucarelli said.

There are also tell-tale signs that the lead poisoning is from the corrosion of water pipes, because water just being pumped out of the treatment plant tests very low for lead:

> Water samples are **also taken at the city’s filtration plant where the water leaves the facility**. That test came back at **less than 2 parts per billion**.

The real kicker is that the article quoted (& linked) above concludes by mentioning the next time the city would test their water:

> The next round of testing will be **conducted in 2018**.

Just so we are clear — high lead levels in drinking water need to be reported, no matter if they are outliers or not.  Basic science: you can’t throw away data.  Also, there is no exception to the Lead and Copper Rule.  You need corrosion control.  And finally, any time you have high levels of lead in drinking water, it is a health crisis.  You cannot ignore test results.  You have to investigate further.

The City of Warren is already late on the draw.  Let’s hope they catch up, for their citizens’ sake.

Meanwhile in Sebring:

> **32 people took part in blood screenings** Monday by the Mahoning County District Board of Health and **one individual tested positive for elevated lead levels**

“Two Sundays ago” (that would be Jan24), [according to this WKYC report](http://www.wkyc.com/news/lead-testing-expands-for-sebring-residents/28891566), “out of 176 tested, 5 had elevated levels of lead”.

The people who took part in the lead screenings were [children under 6 and pregnant, and breastfeeding women](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/sebring-ohio-next-flint-water-crisis-lead-copper/).

Now, one positive result doesn’t sound so bad, but as [Michael Moore points out](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/michael-moore/10-things-about-flint-water-tragedy_b_9132150.html), and says better than I ever could:

> **If you have been in Flint anytime from April 2014 to today**, and you’ve drank the water, eaten food cooked with it, washed your clothes in it, taken a shower, brushed your teeth or eaten vegetables from someone’s garden, **you’ve been exposed to and ingested its toxins. When the media says “9,000 children under 6 have been exposed,” that means ALL the children have been exposed because the total number of people under the age of 6 in Flint is… 9,000!**
> The media should just say, “all.” When they say “47 children have tested positive”, that’s just those who’ve drank the water in the last week or so. **Lead enters the body and does it’s damage to the brain immediately. It doesn’t stay in the blood stream for longer than a few days and you can’t detect it after a month**. So **when you hear “47 children”, that’s just those with an exposure in the last 48 hours. It’s really everyone.**

Reread that last sentence.  This means that when it comes to those blood screenings in Sebring yesterday, what the data really means is that 1 child or pregnant woman out of the 32 tested had ingested toxic levels of lead *in the last couple days*.  That’s a much more sobering thought.

Don’t be surprised if we see more stories like this soon as more and more water departments realize they do actually have to report individual instances of high lead levels.

**Edit** — *P.S. * Apparently Warren, OH, Utilities Director Franco Ludarelli also [“never mentioned” the two elevated lead tests in a presentation given to the Warren City Council](http://www.vindy.com/news/2016/feb/02/high-lead-readings-draw-ire-of-council-m/?mobile) last Wednesday (1/27):

> **The presentation was prompted by questions about Warren’s water resulting from news coverage of lead-related problems in Flint, Mich., and Sebring**.
> **Lucarelli said the water coming from the Warren water-treatment plant was fine**, but lead can leach out of lead pipes and fixtures in some homes, causing elevated lead levels in the water, Flask said.
> **Lucarelli did not mention that a house on Perkinswood had a reading of 64 parts per billion – four times higher than the allowable level** set by the federal government – or that the other high reading was less than two blocks away, Flask said. **The other reading was 18 ppb, three parts higher than the allowable level of 15**.

# Echoing Flint: Sebring, OH has lead in its drinking water

Multiple news outlets have been reporting recently about the lead-in-water problems faced by cities all over the US, not just in Flint, Michigan, as we covered in our first cover story a few days ago.  A lot of municipal water systems in the US are old and ill-maintained, and the effects of the lax management and outdated construction of those systems are starting to show.

Sebring, Ohio, a small town of 4,420 in north-eastern Ohio, is “facing a growing drinking water crisis” that seems like an echo of what Flint experienced in 2014-2015.  According to a CBS news report:

> Sebring’s city manager issued an advisory Thursday night … after seven of 20 homes where the water is routinely tested showed levels of lead and copper that exceeded USEPA standards.

The parallels between Flint and Sebring are extensive.  The CBS report also indicates that the local testing and monitoring agencies doctored test results and delayed informing the public, something that Flint residents will sadly understand too well.

> On Sunday, the Ohio EPA said it is taking steps to revoke the license of James Bates, Sebring’s Water Superintendent. They say they have reason to suspect Bates falsified reports, according to WKBN.

The agency claims that Bates “is not properly performing his duties in a manner that is protective of public health.”

Compare that to an [email sent by MDEQ’s Adam Rosenthal](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/09/commentary-mdeq-mistakes-deception-flint-water-crisis/) to City of Flint water sampler Mike Glasgow in June 2015:

> **We hope you have 61 more lead/copper samples collected** and sent to the lab by 6/30/15, **and that they will be below the AL for lead. As of now** with 39 results, **Flint’s 90th percentile is over the AL for lead**.

To reiterate, Rosenthal is asking Glasgow to collect 61 samples of water, such that they will not be over the maximum allowed level for lead.  At the time that Rosenthal writes this, the 90th percentile estimate for Flint’s lead levels is over the federally allowed maximum level.  He wants this to be lower, and the way to do that is to ask Glasgow to collect samples with lower lead counts.

This, of course, is illegal.

FlintWaterStudy.org continues the discussion:

> Instead, the **MDEQ “[revised](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/09/commentary-mdeq-mistakes-deception-flint-water-crisis/#revised)” the City’s original LCR report, invalidating two high lead results, and as a result the 90th percentile was under the 15 ppb action level**. But **validity of the samples** that had low lead in Flint’s water **was never questioned**. This is a problem, because [the City has now admitted that they do not know which homes had lead pipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LTO9irD2f0Y), even though it is stated in writing in the report that all sampled homes had lead pipe.
> … Hence, **the City of Flint has not had a valid LCR** (*Lead and Copper Rule; a federal regulation from the EPA*) sampling event **since the switch to Flint River water**.
> *Clarification in italics is mine*

Meanwhile in Sebring, OH, a similar thing is being talked about.  Officials there, including Mr. Bates the Water Superintendent, were also dragging their feet and cutting corners, according to the state EPA office:

> “The games the Village of Sebring was playing by **giving us incomplete data** time and time again, and **not submitting the required documents**, made it difficult for our field office to determine **whether or not they had notified their customers**,” said Heidi Griesmer, an Ohio EPA representative.

Like in Flint, the water leaving the village’s treatment plant is not contaminated with lead. The problem is “distribution lines”, just as in Flint.  An Ohio EPA spokesman explains:

> Ohio Environmental Protection Agency spokesman James Lee told [WFMJ-TV](http://bit.ly/1nhejzO) in Youngstown that **the lead is not coming from the Sebring water treatment plant** or **the Mahoning River, where the village’s system gets its water**.
> Lee said the agency believes the traces of **lead and copper are coming from** smaller **distribution lines** and **possibly old homes with lead pipes**.

While there is not enough information to say this for sure, the parallels to Flint are remarkable, so it’s not a stretch to at least ask some questions — are the treatments being done to make Mahoning river water palatable also making it more corrosive or acidic?

And when the same spokesman also says things like:

> We are working with Sebring water treatment plant **to make adjustments to minimize leaching of lead into the water**

It also warrants at least *asking* the question — were corrosion control measures in place in the Sebring water system *before* high lead was found in the drinking water?  What *were* those measures?

Ultimately, I think, it will take a study akin to the [Hurley Medical Center study of infant blood levels in Flint](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/09/pediatric-lead-exposure-presentation-from-hurley-medical-center-doctors-concerning-flint-mi/), for the full extent of Sebring’s problem to become clear.  Look for at least some data to be coming out soon, because:

> **A blood lead screening clinic was held Sunday for area residents under age 6**, along with **pregnant or breastfeeding women** who get their water from the village.

Tragedies like the one that unfolded in 2014-2015 in Flint and the one that is unfolding now in Sebring are clear violations of the human right to clean and safe water.  As such, it is imperative that we demand accountability and transparency in our water systems — but to do that, we need political and economic systems that encourage transparency and accountability as well.

In the case of the Flint crisis, the chain of causality leads all the way up to the injustice of uprooting local democracy by imposing single-minded budget slashers as all-powerful Emergency Managers.

Sadly, the case of Sebring also hints at similar mismanagement by private powers. Firstly, the public was notified late, just as they were in Flint.  Initial problems with the village’s lead levels were spotted as early as September 2015, more than four months before the general public was notified.  However, federal law required that the Sebring water treatment plant notify its customers within 30 days of abnormal testing.  That didn’t happen, [according to the Columbus Dispatch](http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/01/29/EPA-places-two-employees-on-leave-in-Sebring-water-controversy.html):

> …questions about the water in the community arose as early as fall 2015.
> Sebring’s water treatment plant is required by federal law to notify customers within 30 days of learning that the water has level (sic) above the excess allowable level.

Secondly, Ohio Governor Jim Kasich is already fielding questions about his administration’s handling of the crisis, including at the most recent Republican presidential debate. And Kasich is already trundling out the same sort of not-quite-truths that characterized the Snyder administration’s early handling of the water crisis in Flint (if I had a nickel for every time I read about the “Flint City Council voting 7-1 to approve the KWA”…).  Also very telling was the fact that he compared the crisis in Flint not with the ongoing crisis in Sebring, but with a long-ago water contamination incident in Toledo in 2014.  [Again from the Dispatch](http://www.dispatch.com/content/stories/local/2016/01/29/EPA-places-two-employees-on-leave-in-Sebring-water-controversy.html):

> **Kasich cited specifically the 2014 water crisis in Toledo**, when toxic algae contaminated Toledo’s drinking water and forced that water system to shut down for several days. **He mentioned Toledo and not Sebring** during the debate, **he said, because he believed Toledo’s problems and Flint’s came from a tainted water source**, and that **Flint was different from Sebring**. But that is **not exactly correct: In both Sebring and Flint, it appears water system operators did not control the acidity of the water. Water that is too acidic can corrode pipes and fixtures that contain lead**, leaching lead into tap water.
 
I would be less kind than the author of the Dispatch and say that Kasich was in fact flat-out telling falsehoods, or else totally confused, when he said that Flint’s poisonous water came from a “tainted water source”.  If at this point you are a high-ranking elected official and you don’t understand the process of lead contamination in Flint, you are neglecting your duties.  If you’re a high-ranking official who is overseeing almost an identical crisis in your own jurisdiction, it is nigh-criminally negligent not to know what is causing it.

Keep an eye on Sebring, Ohio.  The measured lead levels there (only from regular testing sites) already exceeds the federal allowance — 21 ppb according to CBS.  The maximum allowed level is 15 ppb.  Once data starts coming in from blood lead screenings, be prepared to hear a lot more about this Ohio town.

# Long before citizens, state officials in Flint got clean water

Mother Jones is reporting that according to newly released emails from the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the Department of Natural Resources, and the Department of Transportation, Management, and Budget, [state employees in Flint were given water coolers just days after the City of Flint announced that the water coming out of their faucets was in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/01/snyder-administration-started-trucking-clean-water-state-buildings).

According to the article, employees at these state agencies who were stationed in Flint heard about the notices being sent out by the city and made a stir about the safety of their water at work.
Within days, all floors of the Department of Transportation, Management and Budget office building were equipped with water coolers so that employees had the right to “choose which water to drink”.

From the emails:

> The City of Flint recently sent out the attached notice regarding violations to the drinking water standards.  While the City of Flint states that corrective actions are not necessary, DTMB is in the process of providing a water cooler on each occupied floor, positioned near the water fountain, so you can choose which water to drink. The coolers will arrive today and will be provided as long as the public water does not meet treatment requirements.

Let’s not forget that at this point in time, the city was telling its ordinary residents (read: poor, black & minority, seniors, and undocumented) that “this is not an emergency”, despite the water being carcinogenic.

[The notice](http://solastalgiausa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/tthm-notification-final2.pdf) that the City of Flint mailed out on January 2, 2015 which said that the water violated the Safe Drinking Water Act:

> … …our water system exceeds the TTHM MCL…
> … What does this mean? This is not an emergency. If it had been an emergency, you would have been notified within 24 hours.
> People who drink water containing trihalomethanes in excess of the MCL over many years may experience problems with their liver, kidneys, or central nervous system, and may have an increased risk of getting cancer.

If I got that notice in the mail, I’d want a water cooler too.
But it seems that only those who work for the Snyder administration are worthy of special water shipments to Flint?  By the administration’s logic, everyone else can just wait for the National Guard.

# Not An Apology: The poisoning of Flint, Michigan’s drinking water

This article was on the front page of the New York Times on January 20.

![](screen-shot-2016-01-28-at-4-03-42-pm.png)  
[Snapshot from New York Times website](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/us/obama-set-to-meet-with-mayor-of-flint-about-water-crisis.html)

Pretty shocking story.  But if you look into it, it’s been all over the front pages of the state press in Michigan for months. Local papers and MLive have been talking about it nonstop for at least five months — that’s how long it has been since a Virginia Tech water contamination expert, who is also a MacArthur (“Genius”) Fellow, [completed a study](http://flintwaterstudy.org/) concluding that the water coming out of the taps in Flint, Michigan contained dangerously high levels of lead.  And the roots of the problem go back at least to June 21, 2013, when Flint Emergency Manager Ed Kurtz signed an executive resolution switching over the city’s primary water supply from Lake Huron (via a Detroit Water and Sewerage Department pipeline) to the Flint River.  And the problem has been a national health crisis at least since [a report released in September 2015 by the Hurley Medical Center](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/09/pediatric-lead-exposure-presentation-from-hurley-medical-center-doctors-concerning-flint-mi/) studying infants and children under 5 years of age showed that the proportion of children under 5 in tested areas of Flint had levels of Elevated Blood Lead (anything over 5 micrograms/deciliter of blood) that were significantly higher than they had been before the city made the switch to river water.

In plain language, infants and children are being poisoned with lead, in a city where the levels of lead in drinking water have been scientifically measured to be dangerously high.

It’s not hard to connect those two dots.

But the story of Flint’s water crisis is a lot larger, and, if anything, even more alarming than the headlines show. A closer look at the entire sad story reveals that not only were lead levels in Flint, Michigan’s water system insanely elevated in 2015, but it was a string of four health and water crises, and consistent denial of them by the state, that culminated in the discovery that the water coming out of Flint residents’ faucets was poisoned with lead.

It all begins much earlier than you might think. The butterfly flapped its wings, so to speak, in October 2010, setting of a chain of events and consequences that persists to the present day. In October 2010, high-ranking officials from Flint and surrounding counties [decided to inaugurate a new public water corporation](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2010/10/karegnondi_water_authority_is.html) that would specifically serve the city and its neighboring areas.  Up to that point, Flint had been using water piped to the city through [a Detroit Water and Sewerage Department (DWSD) pipeline](http://www.gcdcwws.com/images/contentImages/file/10152015ContractToUseDWSDWtr.pdf) that connects to the Genesee County Drain Commission’s water system at a pumping station at the corner of Baxter and Potter Rd.’s in Genesee County (pumping station GN-01), which in turn connects to the Flint city water distribution system near the corner of Center Road and Pierson Road in Genesee County (see above link).

This arrangement had been in place ever since June 6, 1964, when Flint signed a contract with the DWSD to deliver Detroit water, which is pumped to that city from Lake Huron.  The new project was called the “Karegnondi Water Authority” (KWA), and it would be Flint’s own pipeline to bring in Lake Huron water to the city.

Interestingly enough, the last time Flint made such a drastic change in its water source (in 1964) was after a failed private venture by billionaire Samuel Catsman – fossil fuel, concrete, and real estate tycoon – whose plan was to, wait for it, build a pipeline that would pump water to Flint from Lake Huron. Through his own misbehavior, Catsman turned his lucrative contract into charges for corruption.  His crime was the real-estate equivalent of insider trading: [selling plots of land along the proposed route of his private pipeline at a huge markup](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2012/11/ghosts_of_corruption_still_lin.html). In the end, the charges against Catsman were dropped, and his profits repaid, but the scandal did climax with the arrest of co-conspirator, Flint City Manager Robert A. Carter. The board of directors of the KWA, very aware of the failure of this last, similar venture, were publicly very conscientious about avoiding the pitfalls of the past.  “We know the history and want to be sure everything is transparent” this time, said county Drain Commissioner Jeff Wright (see link above).

In March 2013, the Flint City Council [voted 7-1](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/10/how_the_flint_water_crisis_eme.html#1) in favor of adopting the (as-yet-unbuilt) KWA as the new water source for the city.  The decision was [signed off on by State officials](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2013/04/state_gives_flint_ok_t.html#incart_river_default), including Treasurer Andy Dillon.  This was necessary because Flint is actually under the direct control of Emergency Managers that are accountable only to the Governor’s office.

Before we go too deep into dates, timelines, and cause & effect, however, we should take a step back and remember what this crisis is really about.  To that end, here are just a few pictures that introduce the human crisis that has been unfolding in Flint for the past 18 months.

What you can plainly see, however, is that the children themselves are worried, concerned, and confused – children know when their parents are truly anxious over something, and that is how you know this crisis is NOT blown out of proportion… contrary to what state officials were saying last fall.  [Photo by Jake Mays for MLive](http://www.mlive.com/news/saginaw/index.ssf/2016/01/saginaw_pastors_to_distribute.html) (picture 5/43 in the slideshow).

People have been poisoned in Flint.

That is the real story here — not the regulatory failures, not the governor’s apology, not the National Guard being mobilized.

And, as Flint resident Connor Coyne wrote in an article for Vox.com, the story is not about a failure of local government, because [Flint’s Emergency Manager hierarchy strips local governments of control over all major decisions in the first place](http://www.vox.com/2016/1/20/10789810/flint-michigan-water-crisis):

> The stage was set on March 16, 2011, when **Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder signed Public Act 4**. This measure **broadened an earlier law that provided an “emergency financial manager”** for financially distressed cities and school districts.
> … The need for an emergency manager was **determined by a series of highly subjective criteria** [see Michigan Radio report here](http://michiganradio.org/post/emergency-financial-manager-controversy-continues). **Almost every city that got one was a poor, African-American-majority city devastated by a shrinking industrial sector**: Flint, Pontiac, Detroit, Highland Park, Benton Harbor, and so on.
> Flint was one of the first cities to be assigned an emergency manager in 2011, and over the course of four years had four such managers.  **One of the first manager’s first acts was to suspend local government** [see Sec 9(1)ee here](https://www.cityofflint.com/wp-content/uploads/CityPDF/014.pdf), and this remained essentially in force until the departure of the last emergency manager in 2015. Even today, Flint is under the scrutiny of a **“transition advisory board” that has veto power over any local decision**, and that has frequently overstepped its professed limited mandate to assure fiscal restraint.
> … Some emergency managers, true, **delegated limited responsibilities to the mayor or to members of the city council**, but they **always retained (and used) their powers to void any decision with which they disagreed**. This is **the key point** that early coverage by flagship newspapers like **the New York Times and the Washington Post neglected to mention: From 2011 to 2015, Flint officials had no real control over municipal policy.**
> For example, [a Newsweek article](http://www.newsweek.com/flint-cheapskate-city-poisoned-its-children-381717) from October 2015 was titled “Flint: The Cheapskate City That Poisoned Its Children.”
> A [New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/09/us/flint-michigan-detroit-water-supply-lead.html) reports that “Flint’s mayor, Dayne Walling … had attended a 2014 event to celebrate the switch to the new water supply,” without mentioning that the emergency manager who had actually signed on for the switch was also present at that event.
> A [Washington Post article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/12/15/toxic-water-soaring-lead-levels-in-childrens-blood-create-state-of-emergency-in-flint-mich/) from last December **doesn’t even utter the words “emergency Manager.”**
> **It’s those two words — “emergency manager” — that differentiate Flint from all but a handful of cities around the country, and which made it particularly vulnerable to the kind of reckless oversight that led to our contaminated water.**
> *(Added emphasis is mine, links in brackets are mine)*

With these facts in mind, and a clear picture of what the problem really is – poisonous drinking water – the timeline of events in Flint will be much easier to follow.

As I said before, in March 2013, the Flint City Council approved a future switch to using the Karegnondi Water Authority (KWA) as the City’s water source.  This switch over to KWA-carried Lake Huron water couldn’t occur, of course, until after the 65-mile new pipeline was completed that would carry raw lake water [from the KWA’s pumping station on the shores of the lake, on a property near the Sanilac-St. Clair County line](http://thecountypress.mihomepaper.com/news/2009-08-19/Front_Page/Lapeer_officials_back_new_regional_water_system.html), to Genesee County and Flint. Construction was expected to be completed in late 2016. However, this didn’t address the issue of where to draw drinking water from in the meantime. This was not part of the City Council’s deliberations on joining the KWA. Why? Mayor Dayne Walling explains:

> The governor and the (state) treasurer to their credit recognized it was important for the city’s elected representatives to be included in the decision about the long-term source (of water) because we would be living with it,” he said. “**But once the decision was made in April 2013** (*referring to the decision to use the KWA in the future, which was approved by the Emergency Manager in April*), **it became an operational issue … and I wasn’t directly involved**.
> *(Emphasis mine; clarification in italics; link to article first link below this quote)*

The Flint mayor also explains that [“the decision to use river water…was made by emergency manager Darnell Earley”](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/01/flints_dilemma_how_much_to_spe.html).

Indeed, [a letter from Earley to Sue McCormick at DWSD dated March 7, 2014](http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/michigan/files/201512/earlely_letter.pdf?_ga=1.224901786.1036207224.1446746452), reveals that he was, at that point, firmly decided on the switch to using Flint River water “following the termination of the current contract as of April 17, 2014”:

> **Following DWSD’s April 17, 2013 notice of termination** of the water service contract between the City of Flint and DWSD, **the City of Flint has actively pursued using the Flint River as a temporary water source while the KWA pipeline is being constructed**. We **expect that the Flint Water Treatment Plant** will be fully operational and **capable of treating Flint River water** prior to the date of termination. **In that case, there will be no need for Flint to continue purchasing water to serve its residents and businesses** after April 17, 2014.

Earley concludes the letter by saying that Genesee County may still be interested in purchasing Detroit water, and asking if it would be possible for DWSD to continue a contract at 50% of the previous allotment, through various scenarios (you can read them on page 2 of the link above). However, while this letter does give a strong indication that decisions on how to deal with the Flint water supply in the interim between the expiration of the DWSD contract and the completion of the KWA pipeline were firmly vested in the office of the Emergency Manager, it doesn’t conclusively put the blame on Earley as “the one” who made the decision to funnel Flint River water through the city’s decaying water pipes.

In fact, Walling is actually either confused, mistaken, or not telling the whole truth when he says that “the decision to use river water…was made by emergency manager Darnell Earley”.  Early was Emergency Manager when Mayor Walling made that remark, but Earley was not even Flint’s EM when the City Council voted to transfer water service to the KWA, and he definitely was not the EM when the city started injecting its water supply with water from the Flint River.

For that, we need to go all the way back to 2012, when ex-EM Michael Brown sent a letter to DWSD requesting that Flint be allowed to “blend” the water it purchased from Detroit with water pumped from the Flint River.  As [recently-released emails from the Governor’s office show](http://solastalgiausa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/governors-flint-water-timeline.pdf), the plan to cut Detroit water with cheaper and lower quality river water was intended to cut costs, saving the city between 2 and 3 million dollars a year on the water bill:

> June 26, 2012 – Letter from **Flint EM Mike Brown to DWSD** for permission to **begin blending Flint River water with treated water from DWSD**. The letter indicates that the DEQ is supporting this option and its **implementation would save the City between $2M and $3M annually**.

This is important to realize for understanding the rest of this article, and for understanding the real causes behind the poisoning of the Flint water system:

The decision to use the Flint River was only a cost-cutting measure.

When you read documents released from inside the administration of city and state governments, it is clear that the only considerations that Flint’s Emergency Managers and the Snyder administration talk about are dollars and cents.

When you look at the Flint water crisis from its inception until the present day, it is clear that Flint EMs, MDEQ, and the Snyder administration prioritized profits over people at every step of the way.

When you objectively appraise the situation, it is clear that the moral calculus done by the Snyder administration and Snyder-appointed (unelected) officials was “We need to save a few bucks.  These people can deal with the consequences, because they’re poor and less important to us.”

We can see that already in the plan put forth by Michael Brown in 2012 to “blend” high quality water from DWSD with lower quality water from Flint’s backup water system, and sell it to customers at the same rate as before.  In other words, his plan was to pass off cut-rate water as top-shelf product to the citizens of his own city.

This is only the beginning.

The Governor-appointed Emergency Manager for Flint in March 2013 was Ed Kurtz, a frequent-flyer EM who had been appointed by former governor John Engler as Flint’s first Emergency Manager, from 2002-2004.  He was reappointed to the position by Snyder in August 2012 to replace EM Michael Brown (who later replaced Kurtz in July 2013…Michigan’s EMs are an endlessly revolving door; with the same names popping up in different places).

Besides “signing off” on the KWA agreement on April 16, 2013 (that’s the “decision” that Mayor Walling talked about above, remember), Kurtz also did something much more interesting, utilizing the full executive power vested in him by the Governor’s appointment.

First, he resigned. [Kurtz submitted his resignation to the Governor on May 29, 2013](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2013/05/flint_4.html), but agreed to work for 30 more days, or through “the first week of July”. Kurtz, however, made extensive use of his 30 days.  On June 21, 2013 – 22 days after submitting his resignation – Kurtz submitted a “Resolution Authorizing Approval to Enter into a Professional Engineering Services Contract for the Implementation of Placing the Flint Water Plant into Operation”.  The full text of that resolution can be found [here](http://mediad.publicbroadcasting.net/p/michigan/files/201512/water_plan_resolution.pdf?_ga=1.2902898.392165409.1450095903) (it’s not very long), but the juicy part is below:

> IT RESOLVED, That appropriate City Officials are authorized to **enter into a Professional Engineering Services contract** with Lockwood, Andrews & Newnam, Inc., for the administration of **placing the Flint Water Plant into operation using the Flint River as a primary drinking water source** at a cost of $171,000.00. Funding will come from the Utilities Administration FY14 account 591-536.100-801.000
> *(Emphasis mine, again)*

Five days later, on June 26, 2013 – if you are counting, that is 27 days into his thirty-day “lame-duck” period – Kurtz’s resolution was adopted.  It didn’t take much to pass it: only four other signatures were necessary besides Kurtz’s (the city legal and finance officers, the infrastructure director, and the utilities administrator) to make it legally binding.  And with essentially nothing more than one man’s approval and the acquiescence of four of his friends, a construction firm was handed $171,000 to attach the Flint Water Plant to the Flint River.  As they say, everything else is history.

Speaking of history, let’s look at some ancient history: the 2001 Michigan [Department of Natural Resources report](http://www.michigandnr.com/PUBLICATIONS/PDFS/ifr/ifrlibra/Special/Reports/sr27.pdf) on the Flint River, information that would have been readily available to those in charge of Flint’s “transition” from DWSD water to the River water/KWA plan.  (I’m assuming it would be readily available to them because it was readily available to me, a private citizen.)  Just looking at the executive summary, not even the entire 305-page report, is enough to give one pause about the feasibility of using the Flint River as a source of drinking water:

> Land use in the Flint River watershed is dominated by agriculture (49%) followed by forested (16%), non-forested (15%), urban development (15%), wetland (3%), and water (1%). The loss of wetlands from channelization and tiling has decreased flow stability, increased erosion and sedimentation, and altered stream temperature regimes. Urban **development along the river has had significant affects on water quality**. Continued growth and development in the watershed is **expected to exacerbate unstable flow and degraded water quality conditions**.
> … **Nonpoint source pollution** is the greatest factor that **degrades water quality** in the Flint River watershed. This type of **pollution consists of sediments, nutrients, bacteria, organic chemicals, and inorganic chemicals from agricultural fields, construction sites, parking lots, roads and road crossings, and septic seepage**.
> … Recreational use of the Flint River is high in areas where public access is available. Many people use the river and corridor for fishing, canoeing, swimming, picnicking, and hunting. However, **recreational use suffers because of limited access and pollution (bacteria)**. To achieve recreation potential, new access areas throughout the watershed need to be purchased. **Corrective actions on reducing bacterial contamination must also be taken to assure full body contact recreation is permissible** in the river system.
> *(Emphasis mine)*

Ignorant of, or perhaps in spite of, these indications that the Flint River was not the healthiest water source to bathe in, let alone to drink, the city went ahead with the switch.

On March 12, city officials attended a [ceremonial groundbreaking](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/03/flint_residents_should_be_drin.html) at the Flint Water Plant to inaugurate the process of drawing water from the river. Optimistic sound bites were heard from all around, despite reports of [delays due to inadequate disinfection systems](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/04/flint_river_water_may_flow_fro.html) at the plant. Finally, [on April 25, 2014, Flint Mayor Dayne Walling pressed the button](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/04/closing_the_valve_on_history_f.html) that officially cut off Flint’s supply of water from the DWSD pipeline, and started the flow of Flint River water into the city’s drinking water system. “This is indeed the best choice for the city of Flint going forward,” Darnell Earley was quoted as saying. Walling agreed. “There have been a lot of questions from our customers because this is such a major change,” he admitted, but continued, “when the treated river water starts being pumped into the system, we move from plan to reality. The water quality speaks for itself.”

The small group (only a dozen or so) gathered at the ceremony were photographed triumphantly toasting with glasses of treated water as reporters looked on. However, it is worth mentioning that the pristine water in their glasses didn’t pass through Flint’s water system.  River water wouldn’t begin passing through the Flint water system for some time after the plumbing to Detroit was shut off. According to that same MLive report:

> Officials said it will take about two days before the Flint River water will completely work its way through the treatment plant and flow from resident’s faucets.

Not that it really matters what they drank that day – what is more important is what Flint residents have been forced to drink, and pay for, every day for the past 19 months – but it is always worthwhile to point out a PR stunt when you see it.

So, according to the experts, it could take a couple of days before people could notice any difference in their water. But, would they notice?

Unequivocally, yes. In the immediate days and weeks following the switch, citizen complaints about water quality, hardness, smell, taste, and color multiplied. For example, Flint resident [Bethany Hazard’s complaints were reported by MLive](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/05/state_says_flint_river_water_m.html) on May 23, 2014:

> Hazard, who lives on the city’s west side, said she’s noticed **changes in the appearance of her water** since Mayor Dayne Walling turned off the flow of water supplied by Detroit on April 25.
> … “I finally **started buying my drinking water**,” said Hazard, who lives alone and **still pays at least $90 monthly for water and sewer service**.
> “It’s just weird,” she said of the water coming out of her tap, which she described as **murky or foamy at times** and which requires her “to use tons more dish soap” to produce bubbles.

While Hazard’s complaints were chalked up as only being indications that the Flint River water was “harder” – a term that refers to the amount of metals like calcium and magnesium dissolved in it – other commenters, such as this one on that same MLive article, backed up her comments about the variability in the quality of the water:

> The **water quality is inconsistent**. It **can change radically even within the same day**. I currently do not use any sort of filtration system for my water. **In addition to the pool water smell**, I’ve noticed white deposits on my pots while boiling water (*white deposits are most likely from water hardness; however hard water does not have a “pool water” smell.*)
> *(Clarification added in blue by me)*

Remember that the 2001 DNR report commented on the “unstable flow” of the Flint River, which was now the ultimate source of the drinking water coming out of Hazard’s faucets. And remember Mayor Walling’s own words:

> “The water quality speaks for itself.”  
> —Flint Mayor Dayne Walling
> Apr. 25, 2014

Let’s take Mayor Walling at his word, then, and listen to the water quality speak for itself.

On August 12, 2014, just a few short months after the city switched to using water from the river, [tap water on the west side of Flint tested positive for fecal coliform bacteria](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/08/boil_water_advisory_lifted_in.html). Another positive test appeared in the same area the following day, August 13, this time for fecal coliform bacteria. [Two more positive tests for total coliform bacteria followed on August 14](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/08/second_postivie_ecoli_test_mea.html#incart_river), and a further two positives for total coliform bacteria appeared on August 16 and 17, all within the same area. The city responded by issuing a “boil-water advisory”, by flushing the system by pumping more water through the pipes and flushing fire hydrants, in the hopes of stirring up the water and pushing the bacteria out of the pipes; and, most importantly, by increasing the amount of chlorine additives in the water.

It didn’t completely work. In less than 30 days, another positive test for total coliform bacteria appeared in a different section of the city, and another boil-water advisory was put in place.  [MLive sought comment from the EPA](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/09/flint_issues_boil_water_adviso.html):

> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says positive total coliform tests **suggest there may be a pathway for pathogens and fecal contamination** to enter a drinking water system.
> Total coliforms are **used to determine the adequacy of water treatment and the integrity of the distribution system**, according to EPA.
> “The absence of total coliforms in the distribution system minimizes the likelihood that fecal pathogens are present,” the agency Web site says. “Thus, **total coliforms are used to determine the vulnerability of a system**.”

With at least 6 instances of fecal or total coliform bacteria in the water supply in two different areas of the city, I think it is safe to say that at this point in the timeline, Flint’s new water system had demonstrated its “vulnerability”.  And yet, the city managers refused to address the fundamental vulnerabilities the city’s water system faced.  In fact, it is highly probable that the city’s response to this vulnerability most likely caused the next series of problems: the appearance of a [class of chemicals called trihalomethanes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trihalomethane#Water_pollutants) in the water system.

This might take some explanation for those who haven’t taken a chemistry class in years – such as myself – to understand, but the essence of it is very simple. Trihalomethanes (THMs) are chemical compounds formed by the reaction of organic materials with halogens.  The typical organic material used to synthesize trihalomethanes in a laboratory is methane, a simple molecule composed of one carbon atom surrounded by four hydrogen atoms: CH4. Halogens are highly reactive elements like fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. Because halogens are highly electronegative — that is, they have a strong need to take away bonds/electrons from other compounds — they react with methane through a chain of reactions that progressively replaces the hydrogen atoms in CH4 with halogen atoms.  For example, chlorine gas, Cl2, is commonly added to water as a disinfectant. In a laboratory setting, Cl2 gas is known to progressively pull three hydrogen atoms off of a methane molecule, leaving [a new molecule with the chemical equation CHCl3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chloroform#Production), and producing three molecules of HCl, hydrochloric acid, to balance the chemical equation.  See how the three chlorine atoms just replaced three of the hydrogen atoms in the original methane molecule?  That’s basically how the formation of trihalomethanes works.  Incidentally, CHCl3 has a common name that you might be familiar with: chloroform.

Outside of the lab and in drinking water systems, the exact process of THM formation is less clear.  [According to the World Health Organization](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/THM200605.pdf):

> The **chemistry of the reactions** between chlorine and the organic materials present in water **is complex and, although extensively studied, poorly understood**; however, **important factors include** the type and **concentrations of organic materials** in the raw water, the **chlorine reaction time, temperature, and chlorination pH**.

A scientific article [published in the academic journal Water Research (Urano, Wada, Takemasa 1983)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0043135483902026), straightforwardly states what is now accepted by organizations such as the WHO: THMs are formed by the chlorination of water containing organic (carbon-based) compounds.

> **Trihalomethane (THM) in drinking water is formed by chlorination of humic (*organic sediment*) substances**. In this study, the rates of THM formation in aqueous solution of humic acid were examined under various conditions. The following rate equation was obtained empirically. **[THM] = k (pH − a)[TOC][Cl2]0^m\*t^n.**

[Humic substances](http://www.humicsubstances.org/whatarehs.html) are the organic matter found in soil, water, and underwater sediment.  So in other words, they encompass most of the naturally-occuring carbonaceous molecules in water and soil.  “TOC”, which is seen in the chemical equation at the end of the quote, stands for “total organic carbon” which is synonymous in this case with “humic substances”.
All this is simply to say that it is an overwhelmingly accepted scientific fact that THMs, such as chloroform (CHCl3), are formed through the reaction of organic matter (found in sediment, debris and water) with chlorine compounds.
Yet despite this readily available information, it appears that the city preferred to take only “operational” measures to reduce the public safety threat of bacteria in Flint drinking water. These measures, as an October 1, 2014 Governor’s briefing memo from DEQ official Stephen Busch reveals, included “boosting” chlorine levels in the water system as well as “flushing” the system by opening fire hydrants and pumping more water through the pipes:

![](page-1.jpg)  
“settled debris” – which includes humic substances – has been “dislodged” by contractors illegally using fire hydrants; this debris provided organic fuel for “bacterial contamination”
![](page-2.jpg)  
presence of total coliform indicates system “vulnerability”, as the EPA says
![](page-3.jpg)
![](page-4.jpg)  
“operational” measures to deal with the problem include “boosting chlorine” and “flushing” water from fire hydrants

Just to be clear: the water crisis in Flint at this point (summer 2014) extended only to the broad systemic problems with a leaky and ill-maintained water distribution system, and the immediate problem of a few, but concerning, positive tests for coliform bacteria in the water.  Elevated THM levels were not reported to Flint residents until early January of 2015.  However, there were whispers that something was still not right about the water much earlier than that. In mid-October 2014, just a few weeks after the Department of Environmental Quality’s briefing memo on the coliform bacteria in the Flint water made it to Snyder’s desk, General Motors announced that their Flint Engine Operations plant would no longer be using water from the city.  Instead, the factory struck a deal with Flint Township to [purchase water piped in from Lake Huron, rather than Flint city water piped in from the river](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/10/general_motors_wont_use_flint.html), for their manufacturing process:

> **Chloride levels in treated Flint River water are so high** that **General Motors will no longer use it** at its engine plant here because of **fears it will cause corrosion**.
> … “**Because of all the metal … you don’t want the higher chloride water (to result in) corrosion**,” Wickham said. “**We noticed it some time ago** (and) the discussions have been going on for some time.”

Ordinarily, chloride is not very corrosive in water.  (The reason, if your chemistry knowledge has not been stretched too thin from my arduous explanations above, is because chloride is a weak base, meaning it does not react very strongly with other things to corrode them; also it means that chloride very rarely forms its conjugate strong acid, the extremely corrosive and deadly hydrochloric acid.)  However, the GM statement explicitly cites the high chloride content of the water as the primary reason for the increase in the Flint drinking water’s ability to corrode metal, and the MDEQ briefing for the Governor at the beginning of October 2014 corroborates the elevated chloride levels in the water system – in fact, it takes credit for them. MDEQ’s Stephen Busch said, “the city is boosting chlorine disinfectant residual at locations in the distribution system as needed”, remember?

The [Detroit Free Press](http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2015/10/10/missed-opportunities-flint-water-crisis/73688428/) reports that:

> General Motors announced in October 2014 that it was **pulling its engine plant off Flint water after workers there began noticing rust spots on newly machined parts**.

From the information available, it is possible that the culprit causing GM’s corrosion was ferric chloride, another chlorine-containing compound.  Sources from the EPA, mentioned here below, have noted that ferric chloride can cause metal pipes to corrode when proper corrosion control measures are not taken. But whatever it was, it was definitely causing corrosion.

So from these sources we get the understanding that the city, responding to the incidences of dangerously elevated levels of bacteria in their drinking water, increased the levels of chlorine disinfectants in the water distribution system to a point where GM’s Flint Engine Operations discovered that the water was corroding their metal parts and equipment.

If the water was corroding metal engines, what would stop it from corroding old, decaying metal pipes?

There were other indications that something more serious than an a fecal coliform bacteria infestation was amiss with the Flint water as early as October, 2014.  Recently discovered documents acquired by the The Flint Journal/MLive through the Freedom of Information Act show that at least as far back as October 17, 2014, public officials at the city, county and state level [knew of a possible connection between Flint’s new source of drinking water and a deadly outbreak of Legionnaire’s disease in Flint and Genesee County](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2016/01/documents_show_agencies_knew_o.html).  Legionnaire’s disease is a form of water-borne bacterial pneumonia that can potentially be deadly.  Since the summer of 2014 (around the same time the city was experiencing positive tests for fecal and total coliform bacteria, remember) 10 people in Flint and Genesee County have died from Legionnaire’s disease, a sharp increase from years past. According to the MLive article:

> Officials said there’s no evidence of a clear link between the outbreak and the decision to use the river as the city’s water source in April 2014, but documents show **public officials in the city, Genesee County and the state were aware of the potential connection more than a year before disclosing it**.
> … Worry about the **river’s possible role as a source of Legionnaires’ dates back to at least Oct. 17, 2014**, when representatives of the county Health Department and the city’s water treatment plant met, **discussing the county’s “concerns regarding the increase in Legionella cases and possible association with the municipal water system**,” a county email says.
> … **County health investigators reported they ran into a wall of resistance from the city water officials** as they attempted to gather information about **possible sources of contamination in Flint’s water system**.
> An internal email from a Health Department supervisor on Jan. 27, 2015, says **employees at Flint’s water treatment plant had not responded in months to “multiple written and verbal requests”** for information, slowing progress on the probe.
> **In the same month** that the email was written, **two new cases of Legionnaires’ were reported in the county**.
> … **Information about the Legionnaire’s outbreak was shared with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention**, according to an email from an employee with the federal agency from April 2015.
> The **email calls the Flint area outbreak “very large, one of the largest we know of in the past decade and community-wide, and in our opinion and experience it needs a comprehensive investigation.”**
> […](#) Communication between the city and the county during the Legionnaires’ investigation became so strained that the **county resorted to filing a Freedom of Information Act request to get information it sought from the city in January 2015**.
> The FOIA asks the city for information including “specific water testing locations and laboratory results … for coliform, E-coli, Heterotropic Bacteria and trihalomethanes.”
> **The same request sought a map or list of locations detailing dead ends in the water system and areas of low pressure — potential breeding grounds for bacteria**.
> More than **five weeks later, the city had not responded to the FOIA request** and a health supervisor with the county said **the city’s “lack of cooperation continues to prevent my office from performing our responsibilities.”**
> … The **Michigan Department of Environmental Quality was aware** of the potential **connection between Flint water and Legionnaires in early October 2014**, but **representatives of the agency never discussed the issue publicly**.
> The lack of any comment about the Legionnaires’ outbreak and the possible connection to the river came **despite DEQ officials appearing at public forums dealing with water safety** and as representatives of **the agency issued statements that assured Flint their water was safe**.

None of this information, of course, was made known to the public.  If the public was reading MLive in 2014, they might have seen the article on GM dumping the river water in favor of going back to lake water, but the Legionnaire’s disease revelation was suppressed until 2016: 15 months after the initial meeting between the Genesee County Health department and the Flint Water Treatment Plant employees. State, county and local officials at all levels seemed fixated on keeping the “story” as small as possible and out of the “news cycle”, regardless of the real consequences of doing so. Communication to the public was discouraged.

However, when a law is broken, no matter how inconvenient it is for the breaker of that law, the public is inconveniently required by law to know about it. This is why on January 2, 2015, Flint residents received a letter in the mail from the city. It informed them, although without ever using the words “Safe Drinking Water Act”, that their drinking water was in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act.  In particular, the levels of TTHM (that stands for “total trihalomethanes” and is an amalgamated total of the chloroform, bromoform, dichlorobromomethane, and dibromochloromethane counts in the water) were above the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) set by the EPA.  The MCL for TTHM is 80 ug/L and the highest samples taken in Flint were 99 ug/L.  The letter stressed that this was “not an emergency” and promised that the city was “working on solutions to correct the problem”, but was light on details:

> Our water system was recently found to be **in violation of a drinking water standard**. (*This means: in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act*) Although this incident was not an emergency, as our customers, you have a right to know what happened and what we are doing to correct this situation.
> We routinely monitor for the presence of drinking water contaminants. **Samples were collected for total trihalomethanes (TTHM) analysis** from **eight locations** on a quarterly basis (**May 21, August 21, and November 20 of 2014**). The average of the results at ANY of the eight locations must not exceed the maximum contaminant level (MCL) for TTHMs, otherwise our water system exceeds the Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL). **The standard for TTHMs is 80 ug/L. The location reporting the highest TTHM level was 99 ug/L; thus, our water system exceeds the TTHM MCL** (*If it exceeds the MCL, this means: the city’s water is in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act.*)
> … What does this mean? This is not an emergency. If it had been an emergency, you would have been notified within 24 hours.
> People **who drink water containing trihalomethanes in excess of the MCL over many years** may experience **problems with their liver, kidneys, or central nervous system**, and may have an **increased risk of getting cancer**.
> … We are **currently working on solutions to correct the problem. We anticipate resolving the problem in 2015**.
> *(Clarification in italics by me)*

So, after opening a pipeline supplying drinking water from a river known to be unhealthy, and then being surprised that so much bacteria ended up in the water pipes; after dosing the same bacteria-laden water with high amounts of chlorine disinfectants that are well-known to interact with organic compounds (bacteria, by the way, are made almost entirely of organic compounds, and they eat organic compounds to live) to produce chloroform and other harmful byproducts (THMs), then being shocked that levels of THMs skyrocketed; after all of that, city officials refused to believe they had an emergency on their hands, and even had the audacity to assume that citizens would feel safe knowing only that the problem would be fixed “sometime this year”.

The situation on the ground, and in citizens’ homes, could not have been more different. [Michigan Radio reports some shocking reactions](http://michiganradio.org/post/how-people-flint-were-stripped-basic-human-need-safe-drinking-water#stream/0):

> Flint resident Amber Hasan says the smell (*from chlorinated water*) wasn’t the scary part.
> “**My eyes are burning in the shower** and I was like, ‘oh my goodness, like, what’s going on?’ I get out the shower and **I can’t see for a minute because my eyes are burning from whatever**,” said Hasan.
> Meanwhile, six miles south of Hasan’s house, Lee Anne Walters started noticing alarming clumps of hair in her shower drain.
> “**I had lost a bunch of hair**,” says Walters. “**At one point I had lost all my eyelashes**.”
> … **It turns out: the city dumped too much chlorine in the water, so much that a by-product of the disinfectant, called trihalomethane, was above levels set by the federal government**. Over time, exposure to trihalomethane can increase the risk of cancer and other health problems.

Chloroform and other trihalomethanes are easily absorbed through the skin, [according to a WHO report](http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/chemicals/en/trihalomethanes.pdf).

> Chloroform is **readily absorbed through the skin of humans** and animals, and significant dermal **absorption of chloroform from water while showering has been demonstrated** (Jo et al., 1990a). **Hydration of the skin appears to accelerate absorption** of chloroform. (pg. 16)

Chloroform and other suspicious chemicals coming out of the faucet sounds like an emergency indeed, especially when the water stings your eyes and temporarily blinds you, makes your hair and eyelashes fall out, and contains carcinogenic compounds that are being absorbed “readily” through your skin into your body. But in the eyes of the city, this was not an emergency, apparently.

Citizens crowded City Hall, pleading to city officials to do something – anything – to address the problem.  But they were met with stony indifference that some might say reeked of denial. “The city water is safe to drink,” Mayor Walling said. “My family and I drink it and use it every day.”

People were outraged and took to the streets. Tensions escalated. Environmental activist [Erin Brockovitch weighed in](https://www.facebook.com/ErinBrockovichOfficial/posts/10155083082730494) on Facebook, addressing the lack of accountability at all levels of government:

> Now is not the time for the blame game … everyone is responsible from the top down: USEPA, Michigan Department of Environmental Quality, the State of Michigan and the local officials.

Something must have gotten through to Mayor Walling – perhaps the thought of everyone out in the streets voting for someone else – because he quickly changed his tune, going from “the water is safe to drink” to [penning a personal letter to Governor Snyder](http://media.wix.com/ugd/eda965_5a03abdccbba4e0297f2815b3edd1888.pdf) that emphasized “access to safe and clean water is a basic human right” and provided a rather tame plan to ameliorate the damage done. One bullet point from his plan seemed rather anomalous, mostly because it seemed like something that should have been done much earlier:

> **Bring on** experienced river water treatment operational management

Does this not suggest that Flint, up until this point, had not had experienced river water treatment professionals involved in the operation of a water system sourced from a river – and an unhealthy one at that?  They were just wingin’ it?

The rest of the letter is not really worth reprinting, but the link is above.  Suffice it to say, Dayne got scared of all the protestors outside, and nowadays he is ex-Mayor Walling.

A few days after his letter was sent, Walling was also [quoted as saying](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/01/flint_mayor_asks_governor_for.html):

> “**Both the state and federal government need to be actively involved** in improving Flint’s water system … The **governor has a particular responsibility due to Public Act 436,” the state’s emergency manager law**.
> … Dave Murray, a spokesman for Snyder, said the mayor’s request will be taken under consideration once it is received. **Flint has been under state financial management since 2011** and **Walling and the Flint City Council have had limited involvement in City Hall decision-making since**.

It’s important to remember who wears the pants in the relationship between elected and appointed officials in Michigan, and its economically impoverished urban areas like Flint in particular. Elected politicians like Walling have titles like “Mayor”, but the real power is vested in State Governor-appointed accountant like former EM Ed Kurtz (remember him?), who have the power to write and enact legislation with no public oversight, and change the destiny of an entire city in a heartbeat.

So let’s pay attention to the action, and not the sideshow. On January 9, 2015, Darnell Earley, Emergency Manager and pants-wearing appointed official, announced that he was looking to hire a consulting firm with “experience” in managing a river-sourced drinking water system – “experience”, it seems, that Flint had lacked from the get-go. With hilarious understatement, Earley was quoted as saying “we have had some issues managing the supply”, and, “we need to get another set of eyes”.  [MLive reported](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/01/flint_emergency_manager_plans_2.html):

> Earley said he expects to work quickly in **hiring a management company with expertise treating and transmitting river water** to homes and businesses and said his goal is to provide a water source that meets every state and federal safety standards.
> … Despite the problems, **customers in Flint continued to pay the highest water rates in Genesee County**, and last month, the state Department of Environmental Quality found the city in violation of federal standards for excess trihalomethane, a byproduct of the heavy chlorination of the river water.
> …Several members of the **City Council this week called for Flint to resume water purchases from Detroit** until the Karegnondi Water Authority pipeline that’s under construction is completed.
> Earley told MLive-The Flint Journal earlier this week that **reverting to Detroit form (sic) water was cost prohibitive** and said again Friday that **the city “can ill-afford to switch course.”**
> … The emergency manager estimated **the alternative — purchasing Detroit water — would cost Flint $1 million a month** in surcharges alone for **water “that meets the same DEQ standards as the water now available from the Flint River.”**

I hope you noticed, first of all, the blatant lie told by Earley in the last quoted sentence.  He said this on January 9, a week after the city publicly admitted that the quality of their drinking water violated the Safe Drinking Water Act.  Water from Detroit did not violate the Safe Drinking Water Act.  Therefore, it is a complete falsehood to say that the water from Detroit met the same “standards” as the water from the river.

(In an attempt to defend Earley for *technically* telling the truth, one could suggest that what he meant to say was that since the Flint River met *no MDEQ standards*, the water from Detroit would at least meet as many standards as the Flint River did, i.e. none at all. But I think that the pertinent issue in this case, at this moment, is not whether DEQ standards are being met, but rather, that Flint’s drinking water is in violation of national law.

While the internal financial analysis that Earley cited is hard to challenge, the elephant in the room is that while $1 million a month sounds like a hefty sum, the truth is that DWSD offered on January 20, 2015 to basically extend the same offer that they had been extending all along to Flint’s appointed managers: if you want to buy our water, you can pay the same rates as other customers — and we’ll even waive the fee for reconnecting the two cities’ water systems.  But, despite a bona fide public health crisis on their hands, appointed officials continued to talk about budgets rather than health and safety. [As the Detroit News reported in January](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/wq-news/EskYZ9uZNvc):

> “Please know that **DWSD is ready, willing and able to resume service to the city** if you so desire,” the letter [from DWSD](#) says.
> McCormick added if Flint is interested in a long-term arrangement with DWSD, **the service can be immediately connected with no additional charge**. The **same expired contract rate that Flint had been paying in April would apply, but would be modified to reflect a 4 percent increase experienced by all other wholesale customers** in July, she wrote.
> … But Jason Lorenz, a public information officer for Flint, pointed Tuesday to a notice on the city’s website that addresses the offer from DWSD.
> **A city analysis** of the DWSD proposal concludes that **Flint’s costs would increase by more than $12 million per year** at the rates proposed. **That increase, he added, has the potential to be even higher**, as proposed rates are subject to change after July 1.
> “This **increase in costs** would not be in the best interests of the city or its water users, as the city is committed to assuring safety and improving water quality by following its current plan, and reconnecting to DWSD would likely require deferment of existing capital improvements or an additional increase in rates,” Lorenz says.

Just to remind you of the context in which Lorenz made these statements, we’re talking about a citywide drinking water system that is out of compliance with federal safety regulations, and he’s saying that the amount of money the city will have to pay to get safe water is a reason for not getting safe water.

It’s not just Lorenz who is caught with his true priorities exposed here.  The problem goes deeper than that, as a released email from later in the year reveals.  When going over the situation in Flint, the email, seen by the Governor, Assistant Governor, and their office staff, [reveals why Flint officials were dragging their feet on reconnecting the water to DWSD](http://solastalgiausa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/snyder-emails-sold-the-pipe-discrediting-hurley-data.pdf):

> **They can’t reconnect to DWSD even if they wanted to as they sold the connector line**. And, especially **with the new rate increases in Detroit, their citizens would be less able to pay** than they already are. The **water certainly has occasional less than savory aspects like color** because of the apparently more corrosive aspects of the hard water coming from the river, but that has died down with the additional main filters. Taste and smell have been problems also and substantial money has been extended to work on those issues.

Something could be said about the dismissiveness of these internal communications toward the plight of Leeanne Walters or Amber Hasan or other real people living with this problem in Flint. But also — they sold the pipeline?!  What does that say about the total disregard for safety on the part of state financial managers as they tried the very risky maneuver of running an entire city water system on a temporary source of river water?  (With the intention merely to save money.)

Although, the more you think about it, who exactly is taking the burden of the risk here? It definitely isn’t the people who made the decisions to use, switch to, and stay on Flint River water.

In fact, on January 7, 2015, mere days after the city’s mailed notice of noncompliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act, [employees within the State’s Department of Transportation, Management and Budget (DTMB) requested, and received, permanent installation of water coolers](http://www.motherjones.com/environment/2016/01/snyder-administration-started-trucking-clean-water-state-buildings) on every floor of their Flint office building, each one “positioned near the water fountain”.  Fresh, clean water would be brought in to satisfy demand, and service would continue “as long as the public water does not meet treatment requirements”.  DTMB Customer Service cheerfully signs off by reminding employees that by “providing a water cooler on each occupied floor” they are simply allowing their customers “to choose which water to drink”.

If only the rest of the city’s residents had DTMB Customer Service, huh?  To put this in less words, state government officials arranged to have clean water days delivered to their offices days after the city notified residents that the water from the tap was out of compliance with safety standards, and [more than a year before Snyder activated the National Guard](http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2016/01/12/snyder-activates-national-guard-help-flint/78716544/) to distribute clean water to the rest of Flint’s citizens.  That seems pretty undemocratic to me.

Then again, so does Michigan’s whole Emergency Manager system.

Leeanne Walters, meanwhile, was diligently working her complaints up the chain of command. As reported extensively in [this article on FlintWaterStudy.org](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/12/michigan-health-department-hid-evidence-of-health-harm-due-to-lead-contaminated-water-allowed-false-public-assurances-by-mdeq-and-stonewalled-outside-researchers/), her first call was to a nurse at a lead-poisoning hotline.  Walters wanted general information about the rumors of lead contamination in the Flint water.  On the second call, however, she was in tears because her son’s blood lead had increased to 6.5 ug/dL.  The “safe” level of blood lead has recently been dropped from 10 ug/dL to 5 ug/dL, and more up-to-date science suggests that no level of lead in blood is safe.  However, the nurse who responded to Walters’ second call blew her off, reportedly saying “…it is just a few IQ points…it is not the end of the world”.

Walters’ communications with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality also bounced around aimlessly from email inbox to inbox, with no one knowing how to respond to lead levels equivalent to “hazardous waste”.  [City officials tested her water](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/08/hazardous-waste-levels-of-lead-found-in-a-flint-households-water/) in February 2015 and found that it had 104 ppb (parts per billion) of lead. Even this number mystified people in the DEQ office.  Most of the email messages were along the lines of “what should I even say to this person?” Another test by the city in March 2015 showed an even-higher 397 ppb of lead.  But even these outrageously elevated numbers were enough to spur any action from DEQ, which was mostly satisfied giving Walters procedural tactics to deal with the problem, such as running taps for 20-25 minutes before using them, which allows some of the lead particulate sedimentation to flow out of the pipes, but is at best a mitigation measure, not a solution by any means.

One person CC’ed in the email chain, however, was actively interested in getting to the root of the problem.  His name was Miguel del Toral, and he was not an MDEQ employee.  He is the lead-in-water expert at the US EPA’s Region 5 office in Chicago, IL.  After being notified of the situation, del Toral frantically tried to get MDEQ officials to take the reports seriously, and answer his questions.

Was Flint using corrosion control in their pipes?

That’s what del Toral really wanted to know at first.  And for us, it shouldn’t be hard to figure out why. We know that the water from the Flint River is more corrosive to metal than the water from DWSD.  And, as del Toral understood very well, lead in drinking water systems comes mainly from the corrosion of lead soldering in water pipes.  If Flint wasn’t using corrosion control in their pipes, it would provide a reason to back up the evidence that showed dangerously elevated levels of lead in Flint water. The whole exchange is [well documented by FlintWaterStudy.org in their analysis of FOIA-ed MDEQ emails](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/09/commentary-mdeq-mistakes-deception-flint-water-crisis/):

In February 2015, Walters forwarded her test results showing elevated levels of lead to the EPA Region 5 office, which in turn forwarded them to MDEQ. The EPA correctly informed MDEQ that the high lead levels were most possibly due to:

> … the **different chemistry water**…**leaching out contaminants** from the **insides of**…the **pipes**.

Miguel del Toral had a follow-up question, which he relayed through another EPA employee:

> Miguel was wondering if Flint is feeding Phosphates. **Flint must have Optimal Corrosion Control Treatment**-is it Phosphates?

The response from MDEQ, penned by Stephen Busch, claimed, falsely, that:

> The City of Flint…**Has an Optimized Corrosion Control Program** and Conducts quarterly Water Quality Parameter monitoring at 25 sites and **has not had any unusual results**

Del Toral accepted Busch’s statement at the time, although continuing to remind MDEQ about the necessity of corrosion control:

> If I remember correctly, **Detroit is feeding PO4** (*phosphates*) for the LCR (*Lead and Copper Rule*), but since **Flint is no longer part of that interconnection**, I was **wondering what their \<Optimal Corrosion Control\> was**. They are required to have \<Optimal Corrosion Control\> in place which is **why I was asking what they were using**

This takes us to March 2015, when Leeanne Walters again had her house tested by city officials, after flushing for many days.  This time, the result was almost four times higher than the last – 397 ppb – which is also 40 times higher than the WHO maximum safety threshold of 10 ppb.  EPA and MDEQ were flabbergasted.  An email from EPA to MDEQ asks:

> Any thoughts on **how to respond to her?** I’m running **out of ideas**.

MDEQ responded with what would again turn out to be a falsehood; a lie:

> MDEQ’s response, **delivered in a voicemail to Del Toral on March 19, 2015**, stated that **MDEQ had investigated** and found **Ms. Walters’ high lead was due to lead sources in her plumbing**.

In truth, Walters’ house had no lead piping in it at all.  None.  The reason she is so clear about this fact is because all of the piping had been stolen from her house before she purchased it, and she herself had installed new, lead-free, plastic pipes before moving in.

Walters was also able to debunk another one of MDEQ’s lies as well.  [According to FlintWaterStudy.org](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/09/commentary-mdeq-mistakes-deception-flint-water-crisis/):

> Walters also **checked up on the MDEQ statement** that Flint **had “an Optimized Corrosion Control** Program.” She called the City of Flint, and **city officials correctly informed her that there was no program at all**.

When she passed this information along to del Toral, he immediately sent another email to MDEQ asking about the specifics of their corrosion control program, and only this time did he get the truth: Flint had *no corrosion control program at all*.  Extremely concerned, del Toral also stopped by Leeanne Walters home in Flint while making a trip north.  After personally confirming that her household plumbing was plastic and lead-free, he also sent an internal email to EPA saying:

> **Flint has not been operating any corrosion control treatment**, which is **very concerning** given the **likelihood of LSLs** (*lead service lines*) **in the City**

Del Toral also left Walters with water sampling bottles and the contact information for Dr. Marc Edwards of Virginia Tech, a researcher specializing in lead contamination in water systems.  When she called him the next day, he walked her through “an intensive 30-bottle sampling protocol”.  The results, once they arrived at Virginia Tech, stunned Edwards and his senior research scientist Dr. Jeff Parks.  They [showed](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/08/hazardous-waste-levels-of-lead-found-in-a-flint-households-water/):

> The **average lead in was 2,429 ppb lead**, the **high was 13,200 ppb**, and even **after 25 minutes flushing the water never dropped below 200 ppb**.

Those are levels of lead equivalent to hazardous waste.

Del Toral, after being informed of these results, drove back to Flint, arrived just in time to observe the city replacing the Service Line to Walters’ house, tested the old pipe himself, and verified that it was “pure lead”.  At the same juncture, Edwards gathered a team of graduate students, packed water sampling kits and assistants into a van, and drove to Flint.  Since then, [FlintWaterStudy.org](http://flintwaterstudy.org/) has been doing great work both in terms of water sampling and awareness, but also in terms of citizen journalism.  Check out their website for some of the best in-depth reporting on the water crisis.

At this point, del Toral penned [an internal EPA memo, “High Lead Levels in Flint, Michigan — Interim Report”](http://flintwaterstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Miguels-Memo.pdf), dated June 24, 2015, which henceforth shall be referred to as “Miguel’s memo”.

In the memo, del Toral sketches out the breadth and depth of Flint’s drinking water problem, which at that point MDEQ and appointed city officials were still in crisis-management mode to trying minimize and deny:

> Following a change in the water source, the City of **Flint has experienced a number of water quality issues resulting in violations of National Primary Drinking Water Regulations (NPDWR)** including acute and non-acute Coliform Maximum Contaminant Level (MCL) violations and Total Trihalomethanes (TTHM) MCL violations as follows:
> **Acute Coliform** MCL **violation in August 2014**
> **Monthly Coliform** MCL violation in **August 2014**
> **Monthly Coliform** MCL violation in **September 2014**
> **Average TTHM** MCL violation in **December 2014**
> **Average TTHM** MCL violation in **June 2015**

We have talked about all of those violations except for the June 2015 one, which was an extension of the earlier positive test for dangerously elevated trihalomethanes in the water, the notice of which Flint residents received in January 2015.

Miguel’s memo then goes on to talk about the lead crisis:

> In addition, **as of April 30, 2014**, when the City of Flint switched from purchasing finished water from the City of Detroit to using the Flint River as their new water source, the City of **Flint is no longer providing corrosion control treatment for lead and copper**. A **major concern from a public health standpoint is the absence of corrosion control treatment** in the City of Flint for mitigating lead and copper levels in the drinking water. **Recent drinking water sample results indicate the presence of high lead results in the drinking water, which is to be expected in a public water system that is not providing corrosion control treatment**. The lack of any mitigating treatment for lead is of **serious concern for residents that live in homes with lead service lines** or partial lead service lines, **which are common throughout the City of Flint**.

Unsurprisingly, del Toral’s expertise and research also connects the city’s reaction to the TTHM crisis with the ensuing torrent of lead in the water pipes.  How?  Well:

> In addition, following the switch to using the Flint River, the City of Flint **began adding ferric chloride**, a coagulant **used to improve the removal of organic matter, as part of the strategy to reduce the TTHM levels. Studies have shown that an increase in the chloride-to-sulfate mass ratio** in the water can **adversely affect lead levels** by **increasing the galvanic corrosion of lead** in the plumbing network.

The corrosive effect of ferric chloride was acting *on top of* the effect of Flint having no form of corrosion control measures in place *at all*:

> Prior to April 30, 2014, the City of Flint purchased **finished water from the City of Detroit which contained orthophosphate**, a treatment chemical used to control lead and copper levels in the drinking water. **When the City of Flint switched to the Flint River** as their water source on April 30,2014, the **orthophosphate treatment for lead and copper control was not continued**. In effect, the **City of Flint stopped providing treatment used to mitigate lead** and copper levels in the water. In **accordance with the Lead and Copper Rule (LCR)**, all large systems (serving greater than 50,000 persons) are **required to install and maintain corrosion control treatment for lead and copper. In the absence of any corrosion control** treatment, **lead levels** in drinking water can be **expected to increase**.

Even without the excess chlorine and and ferric chloride added to the water, Flint River water would have been more corrosive to the pipes because *nothing* was being added to control corrosion.  So not only did city appointed officials *not* take steps to ensure the safety of their pipes and people, but they *increased* the problem by making the water *more corrosive* while trying to get rid of THMs.

But this, according to Miguel’s memo, was not even the full extent of the wrongdoing that the cost-cutting and corner-cutting of Flint’s appointed officials had encouraged.  Not only were they managing their water system poorly, they were telling residents to test their water quality in a way that would *systematically lower their lead level results*:

> The lack of mitigating treatment is especially concerning as **the high lead levels will likely not be reflected in the City of Flint’s compliance samples** due to the sampling procedures used by the City of Flint for collecting compliance samples. The **instructions from the City of Flint to residents direct the residents to ‘pre-flush’ the taps prior to collecting the compliance samples**. A copy of the instructions provided by the City of Flint to residents will be included in the final report.
> **The practice of pre-flushing before collecting compliance samples has been shown to result in the minimization of lead capture and significant underestimation of lead levels in the drinking water**. Although this practice is not specifically prohibited by the LCR, **it negates the intent of the rule to collect compliance samples under ‘worst-case’ conditions**, which is necessary for statistical validity given the small number of samples collected for lead and copper under the LCR. **This is a serious concern** as the compliance sampling results which are reported by the City of Flint to residents **could provide a false sense of security** to the residents of Flint regarding lead levels in the water and **may result in residents not taking necessary precautions to protect their families from lead in the drinking water. Our concern** regarding the inclusion of ‘preflushing’ in sampling instructions used by public water systems in Michigan **has been raised** with the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ). The **MDEQ has indicated that this practice is not prohibited by the LCR and continues to retain the ‘pre-flushing’ recommendation** in their lead compliance sampling guidance to public water systems in Michigan. A copy of the MDEQ guidance will be included in the final report.

In simple terms, what MDEQ and the city appointed officials were doing was instructing residents to collect samples after running their taps for a certain amount of time.  Del Toral, the regulations expert, and Dr. Edwards, the lead-in-water expert, both agree that this practice will systematically underestimate the amount of lead actually in the water system — for the simple reason that most of the lead particulates will flow out of the tap before you begin your sample.

So there was more lead in the water than the city wanted its residents to know about.  And this lead would undoubtedly be causing serious harm to the health and well-being of the population. Miguel’s memo includes data from Leeanne Walters’ household, commenting on the poisoning of Walters’ five-year-old son:

> Ms. Walters has also provided U.S. EPA with **medical reports on her child’s blood lead** testing indicating that **the child had a low blood lead level (2 ug/dL) prior** to the source water switch **and an elevated blood lead level following the switch (6.5 ug/dL)**.

As we said before, no level of blood lead is safe, but the maximum safety threshold is 5 ug/dL.  Walters’ son was poisoned by lead in the Flint drinking water.

Lead poisoning is irreversible.

Miguel del Toral was beginning to be a problem for MDEQ, and for his superiors at USEPA. On August 4th, 2015, when Leeanne Walters and another Flint resident, Melissa Mays, met with MDEQ officials Liane Shekter-Smith, Stephen Busch, and Brad Wurfel, Walters recalls that Shekter-Smith “bragged that ‘Mr. Del Toral has been handled,’ and that Flint residents would not be hearing from him again”, and his memo “would never be finalized“.  [NPR reported Brad Wurfel as saying](http://www.npr.org/2015/09/29/444497051/high-lead-levels-in-michigan-kids-after-city-switches-water-source) that the memo was the “work of a ‘rogue employee’ and promised the final report…would tell a…different story”.  Walters and Mays recall Wurfel’s demeanor as “smirking and laughing, whenever they expressed concern about elevated lead”.

What exactly happened to Miguel del Toral is unclear, but it involves some amount of complicity between the desires of MDEQ to get him out of the picture and the machinations of his boss at EPA, a political appointee named Susan Hedman.  Hedman has been anonymously described as “uniquely unqualified to lead a federal agency” and “a control freak”, and [reporting has shown that she worked “hand-in-glove” with MDEQ to downplay the crisis in Flint](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2016/01/del-torals-heroic-effort-was-ultimately-vetted-in-the-blood-lead-of-flints-children/).  Basically, Hedman silenced, apologized for, and reassigned del Toral for the duration of the crisis.  [It wasn’t until January 15, 2015, that del Toral was able to contact Walters and Edwards again](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2016/01/miguel-del-toral-emerges-from-epas-house-arrest-flintwaterstudy-supports-requested-federal-relief-for-flint/), although he refused to discuss the details of his 6+ month ordeal.

But in the meantime, Flint was still on river water and borrowed time.  While it was a foregone conclusion, among all but top appointed officials, that the lead in Flint water was dangerously high, the clue that needed investigation and proof now was that the lead was causing harm to those who drank the water.

Enter Mona Hanna-Attisha, a pediatrician at Flint’s Hurley Medical Center. By examining levels of blood lead in two Flint zip codes which were at the highest risk for contaminated water, in two time periods – one in 2013, before the switch to using the River as a primary water source, the other in 2015, one year after the switch – Dr. Hanna-Attisha found that there was [a statistically significant elevation in the average blood lead levels of children under 5](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/09/pediatric-lead-exposure-presentation-from-hurley-medical-center-doctors-concerning-flint-mi/) who were tested after the switch to river water as opposed to those who were tested while Flint was still using DWSD as a primary water source.

In other words, there was more lead in children’s blood when they were drinking water sourced from the Flint River than when they were drinking water sourced from DWSD. The report is simple, but just as in the case of Miguel’s memo, state appointed officials were quick to cast doubt on it.  FOIA-ed emails from Michigan Department of Health and Human Services employee Robert Scott reveal that while the agency eventually had to admit that their own data corroborated the conclusion of Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s study, [they would not publicly admit it](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/12/michigan-health-department-hid-evidence-of-health-harm-due-to-lead-contaminated-water-allowed-false-public-assurances-by-mdeq-and-stonewalled-outside-researchers/):

> At 3:45 pm **on September 24th, Scott wrote an e-mail entitled “One more attempt to recreate Hurley.”** The e-mail confirmed that **Mona-Hanna Attisha’s analysis showing that blood lead had spiked after the switch to Flint River was verified with the DHHS data**. But he also noted that **“I’m sure this one is not for the public.”**  When informed that DHHS had knowledge supporting her analysis late last night, **Hanna-Attisha confirmed that the state never did share those results with her** – rather, the record shows **DHHS was working full time to attack the idea there was any problem with childhood lead poisoning** in Flint.

[Staff emails inside the Snyder administration](http://solastalgiausa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/snyder-emails-sold-the-pipe-discrediting-hurley-data.pdf) also attempt to cast aspersions on the relevance of Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s study:

> **MDHHS epidemiologists continue to review the “data” provided by a Hurley hospital physician** that showed an increase in lead activity following the change in water supply. While we continue to review this data, we have stated publicly that Hurley conducted their analysis in a much different way than we do at the department. Hurley used two partial years of data, MDHHS looked at five comprehensive years and saw no increase outside the normal seasonal increases. The Hurley review was also a much smaller sample than MDHHS data as ours includes all hospital systems in Flint as well as outside laboratories.
> We have also provide the attached data chart that outlines **if the elevated blood lead levels were being driven by a change in water, we would have seen the elevated levels remain high after the change in water source**.

You can review the Hurley study yourself in the links above and see if it seems like it’s scientifically sound or not, but it is my opinion that the use of quotation marks around the word “data” is a desperate attempt to misdirect attention away from the real problem.  Dr. Hanna-Attisha’s study met all scientific standards set by a third party.  On the contrary, the state’s sponsored studies have shown a history of trying to *cut corners on their own rules*.

I also take issue with the last statement in this DHHS email, because it seems to suggest very general trends from very specific data.  The data this DHHS official is citing seems to be this study of the lead levels of children who were tested between 2014-2015:

![](dhhs-lead-tests-2014-2015.png)  
[From FlintWaterStudy.org](http://flintwaterstudy.org/2015/12/michigan-health-department-hid-evidence-of-health-harm-due-to-lead-contaminated-water-allowed-false-public-assurances-by-mdeq-and-stonewalled-outside-researchers/), annotations also by Flint Water Study

Pay attention to the conclusion of the above study.  The DHHS is saying that because there was just a brief spike in child lead levels in the summer of 2014, that means that the water did not definitively cause the rise in blood lead.  But what is the study *for*?  The conclusion says, explicitly:

> the purpose of control charts is to monitor data for the quick detection of abnormal variation

If the purpose of this graph showing a huge spike in child lead levels during the summer of 2014 is for quickly detecting “abnormal variation”, then it has done its job: to quickly detect an abnormality.  The next step is to act to find out what is causing that abnormality, not to point to the fact that the levels went down as a reason for inaction.  A control chart is specifically for detecting short-term variation, and its purpose is to alert you of an abnormality, not to tell you anything about it.  This also begs the question: if knowledge of this short-term alert of an immediate problem was available to DHHS at least by April 2015 (the last month for which data is gathered on the printout above) why are they still debating about it in September?

Despite ham-handed attempts to beat back at her conclusions, Hanna-Attisha’s study had an immediate galvanizing effect on the desires of Flint residents to switch back to safe drinking water from DWSD. On September 24th, the day her study was released, [the Flint Journal ran an editorial](http://www.mlive.com/opinion/flint/index.ssf/2015/09/abandon_flint_river_for_drinki.html) summing up the situation thus far and calling for a return to DWSD water:

> *The following is an opinion of The Flint Journal Editorial Board.*
> **It’s time to abandon the Flint River** and go back to Lake Huron for Flint’s drinking water.
> And it’s up to Gov. Rick Snyder to do it.
> Flint **residents were told they wouldn’t notice any difference** when officials [made the switch](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/04/watch_mayor_dayne_walling_em_d.html) April 25, 2014, after nearly 50 years of getting water from the Detroit pipeline.
> **“The water quality speaks for itself,” Flint Mayor Dayne Walling said** the [day of the switch](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2014/04/watch_mayor_dayne_walling_em_d.html).
> **Today, that quality [is still speaking](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/09/study_shows_twice_as_many_flin.html) and it’s sounding worse by the day**.
> A switch that **was made to save the cash-strapped city money** has **turned into a dangerous waiting game** while crews build a new pipeline to Lake Huron.
> But **with the new pipeline still a year away from completion**, Flint residents can **no longer be asked to drink water that’s** (sic) **safety cannot be guaranteed**.
> **Elevated levels of the chemical TTHM** in the water have **segued into [reports of elevated lead](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/09/study_shows_twice_as_many_flin.html) in the water\*\*. More \*\*Flint infants and children are being found with elevated levels of lead in their blood\*\* since the city switched to using the Flint River as its water source, according to a study from a Hurley Children’s Hospital doctor.
> While scientists debate test results, **residents in one of the poorest cities in America are forced to either buy bottled water or take their chances with a system they’re no longer confident is even safe**.
> This switch was made **while Flint was under control of a state-appointed emergency manager**, and we **call upon the governor to make this right for Flint citizens** by brokering a **return to Detroit water that won’t bankrupt the city of Flint**.

> **Officials have said that returning to Detroit water for the short term is not fiscally sound but that is not enough to justify staying with Flint River water**. Flint is in the midst of a **full-blown water emergency** right now and it is **incomprehensible that a solution cannot be found** with our fellow Michiganders **to deliver healthy water**.
> There is **a lake full of healthy drinking water just an hour away** and the **pipes already in place** to bring it here.

[Released emails from Snyder’s office show](http://flintwaterstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/snyder-emails.pdf) (page 102) that by October 2 the glorified accountants in the Governor’s mansion were tripping over themselves trying to address the problem – but without spending too much money of course.

At 10:57 am, Snyder writes:

> We should help **get all of the facts on the consequences of changing back vs. staying** and **then determine what financing mechanisms** we have available. **If we can provide the financing, then we should let Flint make the decision**.

Just a thought — what would happen if for some reason the State *couldn’t* provide the financing?  Would Flint get to make any decisions at all?

And at 12:33 pm he continues:

> **We need Treasury** to work with Dan and Flint on **a clear side by side comparison of the health benefits and costs of GLWA** (*that is, DWSD*) **vs. a more optimized Flint system**. Also, we need to **look at what financing mechanisms are available** to Flint to pay for any higher cost actions. Please get people working on these two issues ASAP.

This is in response to his staff generally trying to lean him toward the option of reconnecting Flint to DWSD.  Earlier that morning, an advisor had sent Snyder an email which began:

> It appears on the surface (without the deep dive we’ll definitely do on it) that **for $11M we can reconnect to DWSD system for the intervening time** before KWA comes on line. **That may well be the only way to bring any confidence back to the community.**

It still took many days for the state to act — presumably they had financial reports and cost-benefit analyses to produce before they could get in line with what the people in Flint had been demanding for months — but finally on October 7th, 2015, [this email](http://flintwaterstudy.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/snyder-emails.pdf), from MDEQ official Mike Prysby, reporting on a meeting with the Flint Technical Advisory Committee (a group composed of [these people](https://www.cityofflint.com/public-works/water-advisory-committees/)), surfaces (on pg. 122):

> Below is a summary of the Flint TAC meeting to obtain the committee’s endorsement to switch back to Detroit water.
> 1. The TAC **endorses the switch back to the DWSD**
> 2. **Marc Edwards** of VA Tech **supports the switchover to DWSD** with conclusion that **Flint River water with corrosion control will still be 4 times more corrosive than water from DWSD after 5 weeks of treatment**.
> 3. Genesee County states **two weeks to prepare pipeline for re-use** (flush, disinfect, sample, etc)
> 4. **Supplemental corrosion control still needed** with DWSD water and ACT 399 submittal can be made in approx one week.
> 5. **No pros were brought to the table for staying** on the Flint River.

So, on October 8, 2015, only a day after the Flint TAC recommended that the city return to using DWSD water, [a whole week after Genesee County declared a public health emergency](http://www.mlive.com/news/flint/index.ssf/2015/10/genesee_county_leaders_warn_do.html), and almost nine months since the first confirmed case of lead poisoning due to Governor-appointed Emergency Manager decisions, Rick Snyder finally announced that the State would be coordinating funds to reconnect Flint to the DWSD system.

With the stroke of a single pen, the momentum of an 18-month long manmade crisis in Flint was finally arrested.  And yet, 18 months previous, it was the stroke of another single pen – either that of Snyder-appointed EM Ed Kurtz or his predecessor Michael Brown depending on how you look at it – that had set the crisis into motion.

It’s hard to feel that Snyder’s actions are apologetic, seeing as he oversaw the conception, development, and denial of this man-made crisis as well as its (supposed) resolution.

And, let’s not forget, he was late.

**There were four health and water crises in Flint. **

There was a health crisis in the **summer of 2014: coliform bacteria.**

There was a health crisis in the **fall of 2014: Legionnaire’s disease.**

There was a health crisis in the **winter of 2014-2015: trihalomethanes,** caused by bungling attempts to solve the previous crises.

There was a health crisis in the **early spring of 2015: elevated lead levels in tap water**; which was **proven in early fall of 2015 to have significant effects on blood lead levels** of children & infants.

**Through all four crises, Snyder was silent**, unless he was engaging his subordinates to deny, minimize and mock the suffering of Flint’s residents.

He was also late to declare a state of emergency.  He didn’t do that until January 6, 2016. That is more than three months after Genesee County declared a public health emergency.

Late again.

It is interesting to hear the words that Flint residents use to describe their situation.  Almost every one uses the words “water is a human right”.

Flint City Council President Kerry Nelson was explicit when invited to a meeting of the Council of Graduate Students at Michigan State University on January 27, 2016. “**Clean water is a human right**“, he said. “**Every person in Flint has been affected one way or another**” by this crisis, and the crisis stems from the fact that “those like me” who were elected to serve the people, “had no power” to avoid, address, or fix the crisis.  The **Emergency Manager system amounts to “private dictatorship”**, he said, and it is absurd to strip power away from local officials on grounds of financial irresponsibility because “if we don’t have the checkbook, we can’t balance it in the first place”.

City Councilman Herbert Winfrey agreed. “**When you give all power to one person, and that person is only interested in saving money**” that will inevitably result in illegal corner-cutting to reduce costs.  Not to mention, he pointed out, that **city managers are literally “asking people to purchase something they can’t use”** — and, even more ridiculously, because “**safe water is a human right**“, Flint water is among the most expensive in the country.  This comes down to a “**class issue…if this had been a more affluent community this wouldn’t have happened**“, Winfrey explained.

Dr. Jawad Shah of MSU and Prof. Robert Bullard of Texas Southern University put an additional point on the Nelson and Winfrey’s remarks.  “This is a question of ethics”, Dr Shah argued.  “**People in Flint are living in a prison ruled by a manager whose only instruction is to slash the budget**“, so can we really be surprised this tragedy was inflicted upon them?  Prof. Bullard, casually known as the “father of environmental justice”, also weighed in. “Don’t hide behind the idea that this was an *accident that happened*“, he opined, furious.  **What is happening in Flint is “a continuance of policies wherein some people don’t matter”, where “individuals on the ground have lost the ability to say no, while individuals in power are subjecting others and not themselves to the risks of their own – preventable – social experiments”**, he said.

The esteemed persons quoted above are right.  The Flint water crisis was the result of a failed social experiment in cost-cutting and regulation-dodging.  This experiment began in 2012 with Governor-appointed Emergency Manager Michael Brown “blending” safe drinking water from DWSD with water from the city’s emergency backup system – the river – to save a couple bucks.  It was fully set into motion by EM Ed Kurtz’s private decision in 2013 to put the Flint Water Treatment Plant into operation as a “primary” source of drinking water.  And along the way, the plan received support and cover fire from the Governor’s office, MDEQ, EPA Region 5 (and especially Susan Hedman), and DHHS.

Our priorities going forward should not be about rooting out who aided and abetted this plan in various government agencies like MDEQ or DHHS.  Because the Emergency Manager system establishes “private dictatorships” in the first place, the opinion of those agencies really doesn’t matter to those in power, unless those agencies are in line with what the EMs, the Governor, and other appointed (non-elected) officials want to do anyway.

Our priorities should be, first and foremost, to rebuild Flint’s water infrastructure in a way that revives trust in the community, from the ground up.

Secondly and not less important, we need to challenge and address the rotten status quo that allows private parties and dictatorial accountants to replace democracy with tyranny in the state’s poorest areas.  **We need to restore accountability and transparency to the political process, so that government “of the people, by the people, and for the people” is not an empty phrase, but a full illustration of our values**. 

We have a long way to go before we have such a democracy: one that protects the air, the water, and its people with equal love and commitment.  But until we set ourselves to the task, there is no way to escape the money-grubbing dictatorial prison in which we currently exist.  The only way out of the prison is the only way that has ever worked in human history: get real citizens organized into real coalitions with the courage and the will to mobilize for progress.

As a non-resident of Flint, I have a limited understanding of where the ground forces are, but two organizations, I think, deserve more mention than they are getting in the typical press releases and humdrum daily reporting: Leeanne Walters and Melissa Mays’ citizen group “Water You Fighting For?” and Nayyirah Shariff’s “Democracy Defense League”.  Both are led by private citizens personally affected by the water crises, and both are working courageously to bring relief, push for change, and raise awareness.  Both need more recognition and support:

## Not An Apology: The poisoning of Flint, Michigan’s drinking water

This article was on the front page of the New York Times on January 20.
