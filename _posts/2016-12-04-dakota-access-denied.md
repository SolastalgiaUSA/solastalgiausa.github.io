title: Dakota Access easement denied; no drilling under Lake Oahe, Army Corps says
date: 2016-12-04 
---

The proposed route of Dakota Access Pipeline project will be denied, and construction on the 1,172-mile underground pipeline will be put on hold indefinitely.  The Army Corps of Engineers released a statement today that said the Corps had denied an easement requested by Energy Transfer Partners LLC, which would have allowed the pipeline company to drill under a reservoir on the Missouri River called Lake Oahe, less than a mile away from the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation.  This decision by the Army Corps, which also requires a full Environmental Impact Statement to be completed for any new pipeline routes, is expected to be very hard for the incoming Donald Trump administration to immediately overturn.  Environmental impact assessments can take up to two years to complete, and the contracts issued to Energy Transfer Partners will expire if construction is delayed past January 1, 2017.

>CANNON BALL, N.D. — The secretary of the Army Corps of Engineers told Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II Sunday that the current route for the controversial Dakota Access pipeline will be denied.

>Archambaut told NBC News after he heard the decision that he was "thankful that there were some leaders in the federal government that realized that something is not right even though it's legal."

>”This is something that will go down in history and I know that it's a blessing for all indigenous peoples," he said.

>The Army Corps of Engineers later released a statement saying they will not approve the easement that would have allowed the proposed pipeline to cross under Lake Oahe, a large reservoir on the Missouri River in North Dakota.

>"Although we have had continuing discussion and exchanges of new information with the Standing Rock Sioux and Dakota Access, it's clear that there's more work to do," the Army's Assistant Secretary for Civil Works, Jo-Ellen Darcy said in the statement Sunday. "The best way to complete that work responsibly and expeditiously is to explore alternate routes for the pipeline crossing."

>…Energy Transfer Partners CEO Kelcy Warren, who remained publicly silent on the pipeline for months as protests forced a halt in the pipeline's construction, told NBC News in an interview in November that he was "100 percent sure that the pipeline will be approved by a Trump administration," regardless of what the Army Corps ultimately decides.

>The company did not immediately respond to request for comment on the Army Corps decision.

>…US Secretary of the Interior Sally Jewell said in a statement that she supported the decision: “The thoughtful approach established by the Army today ensures that there will be an in-depth evaluation of alternative routes for the pipeline and a closer look at potential impacts, as envisioned by [the National Environmental Policy Act]. The Army’s announcement underscores that tribal rights reserved in treaties and federal law, as well as Nation-to-Nation consultation with tribal leaders, are essential components of the analysis to be undertaken in the environmental impact statement going forward.”

>…The big question is how the Trump administration might respond when they finally get into office. Donald Trump has said he’s in favor of finishing the Dakota Access Pipeline, but today’s decision won’t be easy for him to overturn when he enters the White House in January.

>“If one agency makes detailed fact findings about how a project is not in the public interest, the next administration can’t just come in and rip it up right away,” Jan Hasselman, an attorney at Earthjustice who is representing the Standing Rock Sioux, told me on Friday. “They could seek to undo it, but it would be subject to judicial review.”

>In response to the Army’s decision, Standing Rock Sioux Chairman Dave Archambault II said, “We wholeheartedly support the decision of the administration and commend with the utmost gratitude the courage it took on the part of President Obama, the Army Corps, the Department of Justice and the Department of the Interior to take steps to correct the course of history and to do the right thing.”

>Archambault added, "We especially thank all of the other tribal nations and jurisdictions who stood in solidarity with us, and we stand ready to stand with you if and when your people are in need."

>The announcement comes as thousands of Native and non-Native military veterans gathered at Standing Rock, ready to form a "human shield" around the water protectors, who have faced an increasingly violent police crackdown against the resistance movement.

# From the [statement of Standing Rock Tribal Chairman Dave Archambault II](http://standwithstandingrock.net/standing-rock-sioux-tribes-statement-u-s-army-corps-engineers-decision-not-grant-easement/)

>We want to thank everyone who played a role in advocating for this cause. We thank the tribal youth who initiated this movement. We thank the millions of people around the globe who expressed support for our cause. We thank the thousands of people who came to the camps to support us, and the tens of thousands who donated time, talent, and money to our efforts to stand against this pipeline in the name of protecting our water. We especially thank all of the other tribal nations and jurisdictions who stood in solidarity with us, and we stand ready to stand with you if and when your people are in need.

>Throughout this effort I have stressed the importance of acting at all times in a peaceful and prayerful manner – and that is how we will respond to this decision. With this decision we look forward to being able to return home and spend the winter with our families and loved ones, many of whom have sacrificed as well. We look forward to celebrating in wopila, in thanks, in the coming days.

>We hope that Kelcey Warren, Governor Dalrymple, and the incoming Trump administration respect this decision and understand the complex process that led us to this point. When it comes to infrastructure development in Indian Country and with respect to treaty lands, we must strive to work together to reach decisions that reflect the multifaceted considerations of tribes.

>Treaties are paramount law and must be respected, and we welcome dialogue on how to continue to honor that moving forward. We are not opposed to energy independence, economic development, or national security concerns but we must ensure that these decisions are made with the considerations of our Indigenous peoples.

>To our local law enforcement, I hope that we can work together to heal our relationship as we all work to protect the lives and safety of our people. I recognize the extreme stress that the situation caused and look forward to a future that reflects more mutual understanding and respect.
