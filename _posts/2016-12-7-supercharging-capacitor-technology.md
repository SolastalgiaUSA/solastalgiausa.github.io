On Monday, a research team led by scientists from the University of Surrey, in England, revealed a new organic polymer material that could increase supercapacitor energy density by 1,000 to 10,000 times.

What this means is that an electric car powered by capacitor technology could make the trip "from London to Edinburgh" - a distance of 414 miles - on a single charge.  Not only that, but when a capacitor-powered car needed to be charged, the full charging process would take seconds to minutes (about how long it takes to fuel a gasoline-powered car), rather than the 6-8 hours that battery-powered electric cars typically need in order to reach full charge.

A capacitor is a device that stores electricity within an electrical circuit. In its simplest form, it is two parallel conducting plates separated by a gap.  As voltage flows across the circuit, a charge builds up on the plates.  That charge can be released in a controlled way, meaning that capacitors are one way to store electrical energy for later use.   

Electronic devices powered by these capacitors could also be charged "in just a few seconds", the researchers write.

While the total power stored in one of these capacitors is still less than the power of a modern lithium-ion battery design, this new material, which increases the "energy density" of supercapacitors (Watt-hours per kilogram), might point to a better way for powering electric vehicles in a zero or negative-emissions economy.  

Tesla (the electric car manufacturer) CEO Elon Musk has gone on record saying that supercapacitors are the most likely way to power electric vehicles in the future, but a more realistic picture of how this potentially green technology could be put to use can be found in China, which has already installed supercapacitor-powered buses in several major cities, including Shanghai.  Of course, those buses are not using this newest supercapacitor design, which means they can only travel the distance of a few urban stops before needing to recharge.  However, this is where the fact that the buses are powered by capacitors, rather than batteries, comes in handy.  Whereas a battery takes a long time to charge (today's electric cars, as mentioned, need about 6-8 hours to reach a full charge), a capacitor comes to a full charge much, much faster.  So what these Shanghai buses do is hook up their internal capacitors to a power source every time they open their doors to let passengers out at a bus stop.  By the time all the exiting passengers have disembarked , and the new passengers have climbed aboard, the bus is fully recharged and ready to leave for the next station.

You can see a video of a (quite adorably) excited tourist explaining one of these buses on Shanghai's Route 11 below.

Large scale energy storage is a key issue for sustainable survival of the human species on the planet, as solar and wind power needs to be stored somewhere for when the wind is not blowing or the sun not shining.  What this new discovery highlights is that there are many ways of doing that, some of which might be more powerful than previously believed.
